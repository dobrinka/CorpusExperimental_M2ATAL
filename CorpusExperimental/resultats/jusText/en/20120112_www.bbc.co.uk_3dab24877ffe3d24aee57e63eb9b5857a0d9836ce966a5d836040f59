New mums should be advised that it is normal for their baby to cry more if they are breastfed, say experts.
The Medical Research Council team says this irritability is natural, and although formula-fed babies may appear more content and be easier to pacify, breast is still best.

Most UK mums try to breastfeed. Within months the rate drops to a third.
The Department of Health recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first six months after birth.
The most common reason given for women to stop breastfeeding is that "Breast milk alone didn't satisfy my baby", which the MRC scientists say reflects their perception of irritability as a negative signal.
But they say this crankiness in babies is normal and just their natural way of communicating their needs to their mother and is no cause for alarm.
