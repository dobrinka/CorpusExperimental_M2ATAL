'Exercise hormone' may help fight fat
CINCINNATI - We all know exercise contributes to better health and well-being. It makes us feel better!
And now researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School have discovered an 'exercise hormone,"called irisin.
They say this hormone is produced in response to exercise, and that it may be turning people's white fat brown, a process which they say will lessen susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.
