Breakthrough in bid to grow blood vessels in the lab which could revolutionise heart attack and stroke treatment
Scientists are a step closer to making ‘off the shelf’ veins and arteries which could revolutionise treatment for heart attacks and strokes.
A team at Cambridge University has managed to grow all three main types of cells which make up the walls of a blood vessel.
They say the breakthrough could help create blood vessels in the laboratory for surgeons simply to implant into patients – as an alternative to heart bypass treatment and stenting.
Treatment breakthrough: Blood vessels created in the laboratory could be useful in treating cardiovascular disease as blood vessels narrow
One in three deaths in Britain is caused by cardiovascular disease, as a result of blood vessels narrowing or becoming blocked by fatty deposits.
Test tube blood vessels could also be used to treat kidney dialysis patients and leg bypasses, and to fix damaged arteries after accidents for those who might otherwise lose a limb.
The researchers used patients’ own skin cells to make different types of vascular smooth muscle cells.
Dr Sanjay Sinha, who worked on the discovery for four years said: ‘This research represents an important step towards being able to generate the right kind of smooth muscle cells to help construct these new blood vessels.
‘We are very excited about its potential. They could be used to build an artificial artery in a test tube or the stem cells could be injected straight into the heart and they could form within it.’
A biotechnology firm in California managed to grow whole blood vessels in a lab for the first time last June and implanted them into three kidney dialysis patients.
But the Cambridge team say they are the first to grow multiple types which could have more medical uses.
Dr Sinha added: ‘One type of blood vessel will be not suitable for everything.
Heart attack: Cambridge University research could revolutionise the way patients are treated after a cardiac arrest
‘We are looking at making arteries and now we have the tools to engineer all different types of blood vessels which are appropriate for each patient.’
They said their technique was 90 per cent effective in tests and would be suitable for producing blood vessels on an industrial scale, according to the study published in Nature Biotechnology.
Unlike some previous attempts to build veins the new technique does not need plasma – usually taken from animals which can contain chemicals toxic to humans.
Therefore the method has few health risks and a lower likelihood of being rejected by the patient’s body, Dr Sinha said.
His team is ‘particularly excited’ about the hope it could offer adults and children with genetic disorders that degenerate the blood vessels, such as Marfan syndrome which affects around 10,000 Britons.
Their method could be used to grow the cells with the genetic abnormality in a lab for the first time – and then test out ways to treat them.
About 12 per cent of the UK population are diagnosed with heart or circulatory disorders and the number of coronary bypass operations per year is more than 28,000.
Bypass surgery circumvents blocked arteries in the heart and body, often using a blood vessel from another part of the patient’s body.
Sometimes there is not a suitable blood vessel and doctors can use a synthetic one but these become clogged easily and can cause serious infections.
Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘This is very technologically advanced as they have managed to grow more types of cells and there is the potential to scale it up.
‘Growing blood vessels would mean they could be used off-the-shelf and put into patients who need bypasses in the leg and the heart which is currently done using their own veins. It could potentially help heart attack patients as well.’

More to the point, could this be used to fix blood vessels with damaged valves that cause vascular reflux and varicose veins? That's a life-long misery that often enough leads to chronic chronic venous insufficiency, open sores on the legs and weight gain from enforced inactivity ... which of course ultimately adds to the list of people with heart issues. I'd really like to see somebody figure out how to fix that, and save healthcare all over the world a ton of money at so many levels, as well as make people's lives so much better.
Haha! I love how I post a truthful comment here and I am attacked by ignorant people with no sense of reality. Grouse, heart attacks are up because more people eat more meat and dairy and high-fat. Fat causes heart attacks as it sticks to the insides of arteries thus clogging them. High-carb vegan diet prevents heart attacks; just ask Dr. Esselstyn - or Google his name. By the way, carbs from fruit do not make one fat; fat makes one fat, meat makes one fat. Obese people are not on diets of fruits and vegetables. Obese people eat meat and dairy. Lindsey, was your father on a raw diet of fruits and vegetables? Was his fat intake
Ah, more medical genius's here on the Mail's medical articles. Just like the scientific genius's who appear on the science stories. I just wonder, if you have answers to so many medical problems, often in a few short, pithy sentences, why you restrict yourself to the comments columns in a newspaper. Why aren't you out there putting your genius into action?
What a load of tosh Pacificus! My father suffered a large heart attack 4 months ago followed by a blood clot in his artery 2 months later and he is 55 and "low risk", not over weight, not diabetic, low blood pressure, always led an active life (used to scramble) always eat sensibly but his dad died of a heart attack at almost the same age, sometimes its genetic or just plain bad luck. So get down off your high horse and I hope you never have to suffer the pain or worry or having a loved one go through this!
What a waste of time and effort. In order to prevent heart attacks and strokes simply eat a high-carb, low-fat plant based diet. Avoid meat and dairy. It's easy. - Pacificus, Peterborough, UK, 16/1/2012 04:44====So, explain to me please why, since the introduction of high-carb, low-fat plant based diets and avoiding meat and dairy, the number of heart attacks and strokes has INCREASED?
