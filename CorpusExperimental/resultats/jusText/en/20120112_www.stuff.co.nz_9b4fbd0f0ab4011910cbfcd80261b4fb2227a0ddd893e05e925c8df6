People from the Nelson-Marlborough area heading off on holiday are encouraged to take the Healthline number with them – just in case.
Healthline – 0800611116 – is a telephone health advice line that can be called free from landlines and mobile phones.
It is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by registered nurses who can advise about the best thing to do when holiday accidents or illnesses occur.
Depending on a person's symptoms, callers may be encouraged to seek medical treatment or be given advice on how they can manage a condition or minor injury. Occasionally, the nurse may refer you to be seen in the emergency department.
Healthline nurses can also direct you to the nearest GP clinic or after-hours pharmacy.
Healthline is funded by the Ministry of Health and provided under contract by Medibank Health Solutions.
Last quarter more than 3200 calls to Healthline were made from the Nelson-Marlborough area, about 3 per cent of the national total.
