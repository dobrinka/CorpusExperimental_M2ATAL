Mr Rodriguez panicked at first because he had spent three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia in the spring and knew he had to pay part of the $40,000 cost.
But he quickly realised the terrifying invoice couldn’t be right. He called the billing company and found out he wasn’t the only one with sticker shock.
The billing firm, PHY Services, said it was a simple mistake: The subcontractor that prints the bills put the invoice number into the 'amount due' field.
The company has apparently been deluged with complaints and said it would be sending out an apology.
A recording for callers says: 'If you are calling with respect to a billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement. You will be receiving a new statement shortly. '
Mr Rodriguez said that even though no harm was done to his bottom line, the sloppiness surprised him.
'It was a big error,' he said. 'I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out.'
Hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said he didn’t blame Mr Rodriguez for being upset.
Now those idiots will blame it on "computer error" when it was humans who programmed in that mistake in the first place !! Didn't *ANYONE* test the program and check the results *BEFORE* it was delivered to the users ?? What about the users ?? Did they do a User Acceptance Test (UAT) *BEFORE* deploying the program live ?? Now, that poor computer is going to get the blame !!
