  * Injury Prevention: Headphone use and pedestrian injury and death in the United States

The Canadian Press

Date: Tuesday Jan. 17, 2012 7:14 AM ET

TORONTO  Â— A new U.S. study looking at injuries and deaths of pedestrians who
were wearing headphones finds that trains were involved in more than half of
the cases identified.

The researchers studied databases for reports from 2004 to 2011 of accidents
involving people wearing headphones.

Their study published in the journal Injury Prevention on Tuesday found 116
reports of death or injury of pedestrians wearing headphones, of which 81 were
fatal. During the study period, the number of cases tripled.

The researchers suggest that the use of headphones with handheld devices may
pose a safety risk to pedestrians, especially in environments with moving
vehicles.

Fifty-five per cent of the accidents the researchers identified involved
trains, and the majority of victims were male and under the age of 30.

Almost nine out of 10 cases were in urban areas, and almost three in 10 cases
mentioned that a warning was sounded before the crash.

The researchers acknowledged a number of limitations to their research. For
instance, it relied on media reporting "which likely over-publishes tragic
events but vastly under-publishes non-fatal cases."

And factors other than the use of headphones -- such as suicidal intentions,
substance abuse or mental illness -- may have played a role in some of the
pedestrian injuries and fatalities. They suggested more study is needed.

"The use of cellphones and MP3 players is increasing. The risks posed in use
of these devices by drivers are well documented, but little is known about the
association between headphone use and pedestrian injury," wrote the
researchers, based at the University of Maryland.

"The danger in using headphones as a pedestrian may be explained by two
phenomena: auditory masking of outside stimuli (environmental isolation) and
distraction (inattentional blindness)."

The study involved searches of the National Electronic Injury Surveillance
System, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Google News Archives and
Westlaw Campus Research databases.

A first step... not surprising findings. I see people do stupid things when
they're plugged in all the time. Hopefully they can do some solid research and
people realize just how zoned out they really are, to the point of getting
themselves killed.

"Auditory masking of outside stimuli.".....love how this person makes "
wearing earphones" sound so sophisticated and scientific....headphones
ignoring life around you = pain/death....easy as that......

Technology was supposed to make man smarter; we've become antisocial, lazy and
perhaps even less intelligent. Put down the blackberries/iphones and talk to
your neighbour, be it across the table or street.
