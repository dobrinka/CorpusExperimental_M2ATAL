The Delhi High Court on Wednesday ordered the state government to ensure that
artificial limbs are provided within one month to victims of the Sep 7, 2011
blast outside the court premises.

The division bench of Acting Chief Justice A.K. Sikri and Justice R.S. Endlaw,
while hearing a public interest petition, told the Delhi government to pay
money to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, which would provide
artificial limbs to the victims.

Petitioner and blast victim Vipin Kumar Gautam sought the best artificial
limbs for those injured in the blast. His left leg was amputated below the
knee.

The petitioner said the court had earlier directed the state government to
provide best artificial limbs to those victims who suffered permanent
incapacitation, but till now no action had been taken.

Gautam said he had requested deputy commissioner, Delhi government, to provide
him the best prosthetic leg. But till date he was waiting for a response.

Fifteen people were killed and several were disabled in the blast.
