Paul's, are filled. _ _(CBC)_

Officials in Saskatoon say they have brought in extra staff and are assigning
overtime hours in an effort to cope with what they are calling an
unprecedented surge in hospital patients.

"Saskatoon Health Region care providers in Saskatoonâ€™s three hospitals are
facing and addressing an extremely busy period, with a demand for inpatient
beds that is not subsiding," officials said Wednesday.

At a news conference, officials said they are used to dealing with a jump in
patients during the holiday season, but this year has been busier than ever
before and has lasted well into January.

"We have more patients than we're able to have room for with high capacity
right now," Pam Molnar, a nursing manager at St. Paul's Hospital, said. "We
just never had it for this extended period of time before."

Molnar said no single illness accounts for the high volume.

Officials said they are finding space wherever they can, with some day surgery
and recovery room beds being used for the overflow.

They say that while Saskatoon is a growing city, they are not sure if they
need to add more patient beds.

The health region hopes the extra demand subsides.
