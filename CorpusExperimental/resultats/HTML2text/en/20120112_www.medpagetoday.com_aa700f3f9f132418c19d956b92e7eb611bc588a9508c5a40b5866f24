Action Points  

* * *

  * The presence of any event of subclinical atrial fibrillation in the first three months of the study more than doubled the annualized risk of stroke or peripheral emboli and increased the risk of clinically evident atrial fibrillation or flutter.  

  
  

  * The study does not address the question of whether treatment with warfarin or other anticoagulants is indicated for the asymptomatic patient with brief episodes of atrial fibrillation.  

Subclinical atrial fibrillation is relatively common among patients with
pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and is associated
with a higher risk of stroke or systemic embolism, researchers found.

In older patients with hypertension but no history of atrial fibrillation,
10.1% had a subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmia within three months of getting
their implanted device, according to Stuart Connolly, MD, of McMaster
University in Hamilton, Ontario, and colleagues.

Those who did were more than twice as likely to have an ischemic stroke or
systemic embolism over two-and-a-half years of follow-up (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.28
to 4.85), the researchers reported in the Jan. 12 issue of the _New England
Journal of Medicine_.

The group originally reported these findings at the 2010 American Heart
Association meeting.

In an accompanying editorial, Gervasio Lamas, MD, of the Columbia University
Division of Cardiology at Mount Sinai in Miami Beach, Fla., said that the
robustness of the data indicates that the association is true, adding that
questions remain about the clinical significance.

"Until clinical trials targeting the population with short, asymptomatic
episodes of high atrial rate are carried out, the current evidence simply does
not address the question of whether treatment with warfarin or other
anticoagulants is justifiable for the asymptomatic patient who has had a six-
minute episode of atrial fibrillation," he wrote.

"For now, therefore, I will continue to turn to the now-venerable CHADS2
score, consider applying it to patients with asymptomatic episodes of atrial
fibrillation lasting for hours, and make a clinical judgment about the need
for anticoagulation."

About one-quarter of ischemic strokes are unexplained, and subclinical atrial
fibrillation is believed to be a major culprit. Pacemakers can detect
subclinical episodes of rapid atrial rate.

To examine the association between these subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias
and clinical outcomes, Connolly and colleagues started the ASSERT study, which
included 2,580 patients 65 and older enrolled from 23 countries. All of the
patients had hypertension, either a pacemaker (95%) or ICD (5%) placed
recently, and no history of atrial fibrillation.

The researchers monitored the patients for three months with their implantable
devices to detect subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias, defined as episodes
involving an atrial rate greater than 190 beats per minute for more than six
minutes. Follow-up for clinical events lasted for an average of two-and-a-half
years.

The presence of a subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmia within the first three
months was associated with higher rates of clinical atrial fibrillation or
flutter on a surface electrocardiogram (15.7% versus 3.1%; HR 5.56) and
ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (4.2% versus 1.7%; HR 2.49) during
follow-up.

Both differences were statistically significant (_P_≤0.007) and maintained
significance after adjustment for other predictors of stroke.

Of the 51 patients who had an ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, 11 had a
subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmia and none had clinical atrial fibrillation
in the first three months.

The researchers found that the population attributable risk of stroke or
systemic embolism related to subclinical atrial fibrillation was 13%, which is
similar to the attributable risk of stroke associated with clinical atrial
fibrillation found in the Framingham Heart Study.

A second objective in the study was to determine whether continuous atrial
overdrive pacing influenced clinical outcomes. After randomizing the patients
with pacemakers to having overdrive pacing turned on or off, the researchers
found that it did not prevent atrial fibrillation or any other outcome.
However, the study was underpowered to make firm conclusions about overdrive
pacing outcomes.

Connolly and colleagues noted that only 15.7% of patients with subclinical
atrial tachyarrhythmias developed clinical atrial fibrillation, "suggesting
that there can be a lag between subclinical events and clinical detection."

Also, they advised that Holter monitoring for a few days may not detect
subclinical atrial fibrillation as the median time that subclinical
tachyarrhythmias were detected within the first three months was 36 days.

The investigators said that patients with pacemakers may have a higher
prevalence of subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias than other high-risk
populations, suggesting the findings are not generalizable. However, previous
studies have suggested that other elderly populations have a high prevalence
of subclinical atrial fibrillation, they said.

The study was supported by St. Jude Medical.

Connolly reported receiving grant support and lecture fees from St. Jude
Medical. His co-authors reported relationships with St. Jude Medical,
Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Sorin, Biotronik, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bayer,
AstraZeneca, sanofi-aventis, Merck, Meda Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Pfizer, and Cardiome. Three of the authors are employed by St. Jude
Medical.

Lamas reported that St. Jude Medical paid for travel, hotel, and meals for him
to present a research study that the company ultimately decided not to fund.
