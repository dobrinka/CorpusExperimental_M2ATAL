**Matthew Herper** Forbes Staff

Illumina, the leading maker of DNA sequencers, will launch a new machine that
can read a human genome in a little more than a day, dramatically faster than
its current market-dominating machine.

The announcement, made by Illumina chief executive Jay Flatley at the JP Mogan
Healthcare Conference in San Francisco and shared with Forbes in advance of
the meeting, comes only hours after Illumina’s main competitor, Life
Technologies, announced that it would be launching a machine that would
eventually be able to sequence a human genome in just hours for a per-genome
cost of as little as $1,000.

The biggest differences between the two machines will be in quality and cost.
Illumina’s machine, Flatley says, will cost $740,000, and will be available as
an upgrade to the company’s current $690,000 machines. It will provide
scientists with exactly the kind of data that researchers have come to expect:
right now, 90% of DNA base pairs that are sequenced are read out off of an
Illumina machine. Diagnostics businesses like Genomic Health and Sequenom are
already making use of it. “If you want to do large-scale sequencing of human
genomes, Illumina is the way to do it.”

But the Life Technologies Machine, dubbed the Ion Proton, will cost just
$150,000, a dramatic drop in entry cost that may itself entice some scientists
at a time when the National Institutes of Health is expected to cut funding.
Before this announcement, Goldman Sachs estimated that the number of new DNA
sequencers Illumina would place would drop 38%.

The introduction of these two machines sets the stage for a dramatic duel
between perhaps the two most important executives in the commercial turf war
that has led the speed of reading genomes to fall even faster than the tech
industry’s famous Moore’s Law that juiced the speed of microprocessors. On one
side is Flatley, who by launching a machine called the Genome Analyzer five
years ago set DNA sequencing on a rapid track that has dropped the price of
sequencing a person’s DNA from $500,000 to less than $5,000.

On the other is Jonathan Rothberg, who heads Life’s Ion Torrent division.
Rothberg introduced the first of a new generation of faster DNA sequencers,
only to have his company bought by Roche and then dominated by Flatley and
Illumina. A year ago, Rothberg and Life launched a new DNA sequencer, the
Personal Genome Machine, that could do small sequencing jobs (think looking at
the tiny genomes of bacteria) and had a price tag of only $50,000, and cost an
additional $100 each time it was run.

Illumina introduced its own small machine, the MiSeq, that allowed researchers
to get same day results at a cost of $100,000 per machine. So far, the Ion
Torrent PGM has proved more popular.

The time it takes to get results has been one of the few complaints genetics
researchers have had about Illumina’s technology. It can take eight days to
generate genetic data, and then there is another bottleneck as computers must
analyze it. Making same day analysis possible is seen as vital as researchers
try to move DNA into the clinic. With the new machine he is introducing,
Flatley is reducing the selling point of the new Ion Torrent machine.

But Flatley’s not eliminating some major selling points for the new machine,
says Chad Nusbaum, the co-director of the Genome Sequencing and Analysis
Program at the Broad Institute and an early customer on the new Ion Torrent
system. He says he expects data quality on the new Ion Torrent system to be
worse, but not so much so that collecting extra runs won’t help. And at the
end of the day, the low cost to buy the Ion Torrent machine is likely to win
it fans.

“The speed is good, but the cost is going to be a blocker,” for the new
Illumina machine says Nusbaum. “We’re in a world where you can buy a machine
for a lot less. Now machines are getting cheap again, and I think that is what
the world is going to expect. Otherwise it costs you too much to get in the
game.”

![](http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=29ae0e2a-3ffe-4481-bc5c-
acb43412c731)In other words, Flatley finally has some competition – and it’s
not so much like Apple, the company both men idolize, but more like Dell:
cheaper, easier to get, and at least as good. The real winners, as they
continue to compete for both scientific business and a potential role in the
future of medicine, are likely to be scientists and patients.
