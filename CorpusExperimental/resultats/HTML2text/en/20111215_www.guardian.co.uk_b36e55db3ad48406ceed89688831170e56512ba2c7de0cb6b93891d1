# Funding crisis could reverse progress on malaria treatment, experts warn

World Health Organisation report welcomes progress but says Global Fund
shortfall is one of several 'worrisome signs'

# Funding crisis could reverse progress on malaria treatment, experts warn

Hard-won gains in malaria control may be reversed unless more funding is
forthcoming, experts warned as the World Health Organisation (WHO) published
its annual report on progress against the disease.

Deaths from malaria, which predominantly kills babies and children under five,
are down by 26% over the past decade and 33% in the badly-affected African
region, but the world is not on target for its declared goal of reducing them
to near-zero by 2015.

Last year there were 655,000 deaths, a 5% drop compared with 2009. "While this
represents significant progress, the mortality figures are still
disconcertingly high for a disease that is entirely preventable and
treatable," said the report. It added that estimated malaria deaths in the
African region have already been lowered following a general revision of all
child mortality rates by the UN.

Major efforts over the past few years have succeeded in getting insecticide-
treated bednets and new, effective anti-malarial drugs to large numbers of
families. The report noted an increase in the number of bednets delivered to
endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa, from 88.5m in 2009 to 145m in 2010.
Half of all households in the region are now believed to have at least one
net.

Such progress has raised hopes for an end to malaria deaths, but funding has
been insufficient and is now in jeopardy. Donor governments' reluctance to
fill the coffers of the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and Malaria – which has
resulted in the cancellation of the organisation's next grant-awarding round –
is a serious setback.

WHO director general Margaret Chan said in a foreword to the report:
"Worrisome signs suggest that progress might slow, especially in view of
projected decreases in the funding needed to finance universal access to life-
saving malaria prevention and control measures. International funding for
malaria appears to have peaked at $2bn, well short of the $5 to $6bn that are
required. While new commitments, such as those from the United Kingdom, have
been indispensable for maintaining our current gains, they are not sufficient
to achieve the goals that the global malaria community has set."

Domestic spending in endemic countries often seems inadequate, she added.

Malaria control is critical for reaching the health-related millennium
development goals. The next few years will be critical. "We know from
experience how fragile our gains are," said Chan. Over the past few years,
several hundred million long-lasting, insecticide-impregnated nets have been
distributed, but will need replacing in the next few years.

"It is our responsibility to ensure that these and other life-saving
commodities reach all who need them – before our hard-won progress slips
away," said Chan.

There are also major worries over resistance, affecting both artemisinin drugs
– which have transformed malaria treatment – and the insecticide sprays used
inside houses. Resistance to the drugs has now been reported in Cambodia,
Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. Insecticide resistance has been reported in 27
countries in Africa, and 41 worldwide. "Unless properly managed, such
resistance potentially threatens future progress in malaria control," said
Chan.

Even when control measures have brought case numbers down, pressure must be
maintained. Malaria numbers rose in Rwanda and in Sao Tome and Principe in
2009 following reductions. Those areas have now brought cases back down, but
Zambia, which also experienced a rise in 2009, has not yet reversed the trend.

Important progress has been made in the roll-out of rapid diagnostic testing,
which enables healthcare staff to be sure a child's fever is malaria and not
caused by some other illness. Using malaria treatment properly prevents
resistance and saves money.

But funding looks set to drop in 2012 and 2013, triggered primarily by the
crisis at the Global Fund. "This decrease will considerably alter the malaria
control landscape and threaten the sustainability of the multipronged approach
to fighting the disease, which relies heavily on investments in bednets,
indoor residual spraying, diagnostic testing, treatment, research and
innovation," says the WHO.

Dr Robert Newman, director of the WHO's global malaria programme, said: "We
need a fully-resourced Global Fund, new donors and endemic countries to join
forces and address the vast challenges that lie ahead … We need to act with
urgency and resolve to ensure that no one dies from malaria for lack of a $5
bed net, $1 anti-malarial drug [or] a 50 cent diagnostic test."
