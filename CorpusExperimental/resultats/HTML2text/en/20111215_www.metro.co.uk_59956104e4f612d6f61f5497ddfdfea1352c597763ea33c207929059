The Commons defence committee says there is a 'question mark' over whether the
government has fully understood the demands on the forces - particularly their
families - in the coming years.  

In a report on casualties following the introduction of the Armed Forces
Covenant, which sets out the 'moral obligation' to support service personnel,
the committee praises the medical treatment available but questions whether it
is sustainable.

It also criticises the support for children of casualties.  

MPs have urged the government to act swiftly to exclude armed forces'
compensation from the assessment of means-tested benefits.

Committee chairman James Arbuthnot said: 'We, as a committee, have seen how
determined our injured servicemen and women are to achieve the fullest
possible recovery from their injuries.  

'They see it as duty to get better and to return to their units if at all
possible.  

'But we need to have the confidence that such specific treatment, for injuries
hardly ever seen in the general NHS experience, will continue long after an
individual's retirement and into old age.'  

Meanwhile, head of the British armed forces Gen Sir David Richards said
Britain's economic state should be the UK's main focus as 'no country can
defend itself if bankrupt'.
