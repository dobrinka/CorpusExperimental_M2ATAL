#  EasyJet throws disabled businessman off flight as he cannot walk to
emergency exit

By Louie Smith  17/01/2012

Dr. Martin Sabry

A disabled businessman has been thrown off a budget flight - because he could
not walk to the emergency exit.

EasyJet staff told Dr Martin Sabry, 39, who is paralysed from the chest down,
that he could not travel on his own.

He said ground control told him he could board the plane, but the captain
over-ruled the decision and he was told all single passengers must be able to
reach the exit.

Dr Sabry says he often flies for work and had never had this issue. He said
yesterday: "It was so demeaning and unbelievable the way they treated me and
the purser was obnoxiously rude."

Dr Sabry, from Cambridge, waited four hours to speak to bosses, who
apologised, put him on the next flight from Gatwick to Toulouse and paid for
his taxi transfer.

A spokeswoman said: "All passengers travelling alone must be able to make
their way to an exit unaided - it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding
this."
