Elderly care responsibility shared

(UKPA) - 6 hours ago

The NHS and local authorities will share responsibility for elderly care to
end the practice of budgets being shunted between departments, it has been
confirmed.

Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said community health partnerships will be
replaced by health and social care partnerships which will be the
responsibility of both the NHS and councils.

The Scottish Government says it is concerned about the practice of "cost-
shunting", where disputes arise between NHS boards and local authorities over
who should pay for the care of older people. The practice has seen people held
up in hospital beds until the disputes are resolved.

Ms Sturgeon said: "There is too much inconsistency in the quality of care for
adults and older people across Scotland. There is too much variation in the
level of resources invested in care locally by health boards and local
authorities, and in the outcomes that those resources achieve.

"Too many people are unnecessarily admitted to hospital or delayed there when
they are clinically ready to leave hospital. And for too many people, the
experience of moving between health and social care services as their care
needs change is not smooth enough."

She added: "We will introduce legislation to bring about a radical
transformation of community health partnerships (CHPs).

"CHPs, currently subcommittees of NHS boards, will be replaced by health and
social care partnerships which will be the joint and equal responsibility of
the NHS and local government."

Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie welcomed the proposed legislation but
said Labour would have gone further.

She said: "Our vision was for a national care service, as radical as the
creation of the NHS, bringing fairness and raising standards in the provision
of care.

"The SNP would have you believe that we were creating another quango, another
bureaucratic monolith, but that deliberately misunderstands the proposal.
There is no new body, no new civil servants. This is about having national
care standards for services that are delivered locally, a model that is
currently used in the health service."
