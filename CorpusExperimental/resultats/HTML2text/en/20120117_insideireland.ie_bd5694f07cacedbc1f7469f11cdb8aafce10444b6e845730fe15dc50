# SeaGen in Co. Down Given Environmental Green Light

January 17, 2012

By Daniela Cavaliere

The tidal wave energy source at Strangford Lough in Co. Down has been given
the green light today as it poses little threat to marine life, a report has
found. Seals or porpoises have not been affected either.

The SeaGen, the worlds largest commercial tidal energy generator, is capable
of producing enough clean power for 1,500 homes in the area.

Originally installed in 2008, SeaGen operates by a two-blade rotary system
that turns 14 times per minute.

Until now, SeaGen has only operated in daylight hours but today's news could
give the all-clear for night time usage also.

Environment Minister Alex Attwood spoke positively of the news saying: "Marine
Current Turbines has proved that the power of the seas can be harnessed in
harmony with marine life.

"The results of their work will give everyone greater confidence in realising
the economic and environmental benefits that tidal and wave energy can offer
to Northern Ireland, elsewhere in the UK and Ireland as well as other parts of
the world."

SeaGen was built at the historic Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.
