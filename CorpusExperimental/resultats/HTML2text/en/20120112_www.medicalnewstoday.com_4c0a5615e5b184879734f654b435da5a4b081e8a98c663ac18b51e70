According to a study published on _bmj.com_, administering overweight or obese
patients with peptide-1 (GLP-1) - a type of glucagon which is secreted from
the intestine during eating and suppresses appetite, leads to clinically
beneficial weight loss, as well as reduced blood pressure and cholesterol
levels.  
  
The recent introduction of GLP-1 based therapy as a new treatment for type-2
diabetes patients, due to its regulating ability of blood sugar levels, has
also shown to suppress food intake and appetite. The discovery could be used
as an interesting approach to treat obesity.  
  
Researchers at the University of Copenhagen decided to establish the effect of
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on weight loss whilst
studying their effect on blood pressure, cholesterol, liver enzyme levels, and
blood sugar (glycemic) control. They evaluated results of 25 randomized
controlled trials, accounting for differences in study design and quality to
minimize bias, which involved more than 6,000 patients.  
  
The results showed that patients administered with clinically relevant doses
of GLP-1R agonists for at least 20 weeks achieved a greater weight loss
compared with those in the control groups. Both patients with and without
type-2 diabetes benefited from the therapy, although it may have been more
pronounced in those without diabetes.  
  
The researchers discovered that GLP-1R agonists also displayed beneficial
effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, and improved glycemic control in
patients with type 2 diabetes, but noted no statistically important effect on
liver enzymes.  
  
Participants experienced common side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea. However, this did not appear to affect the number of patients
dropping out of the trials, which indicates a relatively high overall patient
satisfaction.  
  
  The researchers comment that their evaluation:  
  

> "..provides convincing evidence that GLP-1R agonists, when given to obese
patients with or without diabetes, result in clinically relevant beneficial
effects on body weight. Additional beneficial effects on blood pressure and
total cholesterol might also be achieved."

  
  
According to them, the intervention "should be considered in patients with
diabetes who are obese or overweight" and recommend for further studies to be
conducted, "to elucidate the effects of GLP-1R agonists in the treatment of
obese patients without diabetes."  
  
Professor Raj Padwal from the University of Alberta writes in an accompanying
editorial that whilst these findings underline the weight-reducing benefits of
GLP-1 agonists, they should not change current practice, arguing that,
"modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment
of type 2 diabetes."  
  
He also refers to the fact that the safety of GLP-1 agonists is still unknown,
saying, "continued and close surveillance of these new agents using all
available data sources is warranted."
