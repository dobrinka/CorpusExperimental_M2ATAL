Cancer in Ottawa 2012: Knowledge to action report

Ottawa has the highest cancer rates in all of Ontario but also boasts the best
cancer survival rates in the province, according to a local health status
report.

**Cancer diagnoses in Ottawa, 2007**| **Total**| **M**| **F**  
---|---|---|---  
**All cancers (combined)**| 3,890| 1,924| 1,966  
Breast| 553| NA| 553  
Lung| 502| 236| 266  
Prostate| 502| 502| NA  
Colorectal| 492| 269| 223  
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma| 173| 98| 75  
Leukemia| 151| 78| 73  
Melanoma| 146| 89| 57  
Kidney| 117| 66| 51  
Body of uterus| 116| NA| 116  
Bladder| 112| 82| 30  
Cervical| 25| NA| 25  
Testicular| 21| 21| NA

The findings of _Cancer in Ottawa 2012_ come from 2007 statistics, the latest
available from Cancer Care Ontario, which also show new cancer cases and total
cancer deaths in Ottawa have increased since the mid-1980s. The average
survival rate has increased, however.

The report also shows the four most common cancers diagnosed in the city —
female breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer — are not unlike most
other areas. But Ottawa does have a lower rate of both prostate and cervical
cancer diagnoses than the rest of Ontario.

For men, the most common cancers were prostate, colorectal, lung and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma. The most deadly of male cancers were lung, colorectal,
prostate and pancreatic cancers.

For women, cancer was most prevalent in the breast, lung, colon and body of
the uterus. The most deadly were lung, breast, colorectal and pancreatic
cancers.

Overall, survival rates have increased in the city between five-year periods
of 1993-1997 and 2003-2007.

The data is about five years old so the report warns the information "may not
be a truly representative picture of the current burden of cancer in Ottawa."

You can read the full report here, which will be presented to the Ottawa Board
of Health on Jan. 16.
