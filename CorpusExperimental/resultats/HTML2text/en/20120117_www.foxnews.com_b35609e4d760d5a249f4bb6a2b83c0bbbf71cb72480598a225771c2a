A New Jersey woman went into labor on a commuter train Monday and gave birth
to a baby boy before it pulled into the station, witnesses said.

The woman and her husband boarded the Manhattan-bound PATH train shortly after
9:30 a.m.  at the Journal Square station in Jersey City, N.J.

Before the train made its second stop at the Newport station, the woman went
into labor.

"She was not in labor long," said Port Authority spokesman Ron Marsico.

The train's conductor made an announcement that the woman had given birth, and
said the train would be skipping stops to 33rd Street in Manhattan.

"God bless the little one," the conductor said.

Cops who responded at 33rd Street said the father calmly delivered the boy on
the floor of the car surrounded by stunned passengers.

The baby was in his dad's arms when cops arrived.

One train rider sacrificed his coat to cover the woman up.

Officials said the 31-year-old new mom and her husband are from Harrison, N.J.

The woman and baby boy were rushed to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in New
York, where they were doing well, officials said.
