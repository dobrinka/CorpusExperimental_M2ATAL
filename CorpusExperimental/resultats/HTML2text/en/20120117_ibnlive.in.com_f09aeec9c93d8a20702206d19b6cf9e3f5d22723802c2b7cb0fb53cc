# Central team examining Drug Resistant TB cases in Mumbai

PTI | 04:01 PM,Jan 17,2012

Mumbai, Jan 17 (PTI) A team of doctors, deputed by the Union Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare, has reached Mumbai to ascertain facts about the
reported cases of Drug Resistant TB cases. The Ministry says, the cases should
be called 'Extensively Drug Resistant-TB' (XDR-TB) and not 'Totally Drug
Resistant TB' (TDR-TB) as per WHO norms, an official release said. The
central team has started analysis of the situation and is in touch with the
health authorities of Maharashtra, Mumbai Municipal Corporation, while also
involving experts from concerned stake-holders, including the Hinduja
Hospital, Mumbai. Hinduja hospital is not accredited to diagnose XDR or TDR,
the release said. "So far as the report from Hinduja Hospital is concerned,
this Hospital Laboratory is not accredited by the Revised National
Tuberculosis Control Programme, for culture and sensitivity for second line
drugs to diagnose Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR)/Totally Drug Resistant
(TDR) cases and is only accredited for conducting Drug Susceptibility Testing
(DST) by liquid culture and sensitivity for first line drug only," it said.
Recently, a proposal for accreditation of Line Probe Assay test (LPA) has been
received and is under process, it added. As of now, the Revised National TB
Control Programme has accredited only following three labs for conducting
quality-assured second-line anti-TB drug susceptibility testing of
flouroquinolones and injectables: National TB Institute (NTI), Bangalore; LRS
Institute of TB and Chest Disease, New Delhi, and National Institute of
Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai. (More) PTI VT NP
