#  Science proves alcohol is fun

DRINKING alcohol makes people feel better because it produces the same
chemicals in the brain as exercising and laughing, a study has proved for the
first time.

Alcohol is addictive because it releases endorphins, which are the body's way
of making us feel pleasure and reward, the researchers showed.

The stress and pain-relieving proteins are naturally released in the brain and
other tissues, producing similar effects to opiates such as morphine.

The discovery of the particular brain regions where the endorphin release
takes place could help scientists develop new treatments to help people
overcome alcohol addiction.

Dr Jennifer Mitchell, of the University of California, who led the study,
said: ''This is something that we've speculated about for 30 years, based on
animal studies, but haven't observed in humans until now. It provides the
first direct evidence of how alcohol makes people feel good.''

Researchers scanned the brains of 13 heavy drinkers and 12 non-drinkers
immediately after they drank alcohol. Their findings, published in the
_Science Translational Medicine_ journal, showed alcohol caused endorphins to
be released in the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex regions.

In all of the volunteers, larger quantities of endorphins released in the
nucleus accumbens were linked to increased feelings of pleasure. Increased
levels of endorphins released in the orbitofrontal cortex were linked to a
greater feeling of intoxication in heavy drinkers, but not in non-drinkers.

Dr Mitchell said: ''This indicates that the brains of heavy or problem
drinkers are changed in a way that makes them more likely to find alcohol
pleasant, and may be a clue to how problem drinking develops in the first
place. That greater feeling of reward might cause them to drink too much.''
