Celebrity chef and Food Network star Paula Deen announced on the "Today" show
Tuesday morning that she was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes three years ago.

Deen said she kept quiet about her condition until she had advice to offer the
public. She announced she has teamed up with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to launch
a program that aims to help people live with Type 2 diabetes and promote a
Novo diabetes drug.

The program is called Diabetes in a New Light and offers tips on food
preparation, stress management and working with doctors on a treatment plan.
Recipes and tips can be found at http://www.Diabetesinanewlight.com.

"I wanted to bring something to the table when I came forward," she said
Tuesday during an appearance on NBC's "Today" show. "I've always been one to
think that I bring hope." When asked if the high-fat, high-caloric recipes she
champions can lead to diabetes, she hedged.

"That is part of the puzzle," she said, but mentioned other factors: genetics,
lifestyle, stress and age.

"On my show I share with you all these yummy, fattening recipes, but I tell
people, 'in moderation,"' she added. "I've always eaten in moderation." Deen
has Type 2 diabetes and takes Victoza, a once-daily noninsulin injection. The
website links to promotional materials for the drug.

Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. In Type 2 diabetes, the body
either does not produce enough insulin or does not use it efficiently,
allowing excess sugar, or glucose, to accumulate in the blood.

The 64-year-old Deen, known as "the Queen of Southern cuisine," appears on
Food Network.
