A study of bushmeat smuggled into the city shows it could spread disease or
even spark pandemics, researchers said Tuesday.

Dr. Denise McAloose, chief pathologist for the New York-based Wildlife
Conservation Society, said no one had tested illegal bushmeat for pathogens
before the study.

Animal parts seized by custom agents at Kennedy Airport were routinely
destroyed until the WCS partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in 2008 for the research.

"We wanted to know if in those confiscated materials there might be anything
of significance, so we started looking," McAloose told the News.

In 2010, the pilot program expanded to airports servicing Philadelphia,
Houston, Atlanta and Washington D.C.

Scientists found simian foamy viruses and two types of herpesviruses in the
animal parts tested.

While the herpesviruses detected are not considered dangerous to people,
related viruses cause disease in humans.

Researchers say the results show potential danger.

“Diseases such as HIV, Ebola, swine flu, avian flu and monkey pox all
originated in wildlife," McAloose said. "We don't know where the next disease
like that might occur."

Some animal skulls, hands, arms and torsos were still fresh in coolers when
confiscated. Others were long dead and dried out.

Tissue from the freshest part each animal, including raw or red muscle, joint
fluid or bone marrow, was preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C.

Scientists from WCS and the American Museum of Natural History used advanced
genetic barcoding technology to identify each animal species.

The 25 primates tested included baboons, mangabeys, guenons, green monkeys and
endangered chimpanzees. They also identified 35 rats.

The study is ongoing, and straw bats that were recently seized at JFK will be
analyzed during the next phase.

Tissues were tested for pathogens at CDC and Columbia University labs.

Three-fourths of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate from contact
with wildlife, and researchers fear the wildlife trade could spur new
pandemics.

"Every point along the trade route, from the hunter to the seller to the
shipper, has the potential to be exposed to whatever that animal was
carrying," said McAloose.

Researchers are calling for more education about the dangers of wildlife
trading and harsher penalties for illegal activity.

in Utah, a state well-known for Mormon communities. Which other celebs belong
