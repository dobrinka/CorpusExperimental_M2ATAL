HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd  
(HCG) has introduced a new technology to treat cancer patients who require
radiotherapy.

"For the first time in Asia, we have introduced TrueBeam Technology in
Ahmedabad and PreScision Artiste in Bangalore. Both these technologies will
help in faster and effective treatment for patients," HCG chairman, Dr B S
Ajaikumar, said.

"TrueBeam can be used for all types of cancer requiring radiotherapy. It is
specifically unique in delivering radiotherapy for its precision. It offers
convenience for the patient by shortening treatment time," Dr Kumar Swamy,
consultant, radiation oncologist, HCG, said.

TrueBeam and PreScision Artiste are two new therapies to treat cancer and use
a re-engineered control system with a multitude of technical innovations to
dynamically synchronise imaging, patient positioning, motion management, and
treatment delivery.
