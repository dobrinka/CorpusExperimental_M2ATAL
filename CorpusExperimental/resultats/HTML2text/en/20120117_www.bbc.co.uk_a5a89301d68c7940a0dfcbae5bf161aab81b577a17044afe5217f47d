# Contaminated nasal spray recalled by medicines watchdog

![Bacterial contamination test](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/57918000
/jpg/_57918005_petrispl.jpg) Lab tests revealed the contamination

Batches of a saline nasal spray sold as Sterimar Isotonic (100ml) in High
Street chemists have been recalled amid safety concerns.

The health watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA) has received warning of possible bacterial contamination.

The affected batches are FE1248b and FE1249. The number is printed on
packaging and the base of the can.

Experts insist there is no immediate health threat.

The two bacteria identified - Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sphingomonas
paucimobilis - are commonly found in soil, water and hospital environments and
human infections are rare.

The bacteria should not affect healthy people. However, those who suffer from
existing sinus or nasal problems, have recently undergone surgery or have a
weakened immune system may be at risk.

The possible symptoms exhibited can be nasal or facial tenderness, discoloured
mucus or a fever.

Consumers are asked that if they have any of the affected batches, to stop
using the product immediately and return it to the retailer. If they exhibit
any of the symptoms listed above then they should consult a healthcare
professional.
