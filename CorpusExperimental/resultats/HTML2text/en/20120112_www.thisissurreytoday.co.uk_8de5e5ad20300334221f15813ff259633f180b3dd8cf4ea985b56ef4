DOCTORS are urging those who have made a new year resolution to quit smoking
to get the help they need.

The NHS is releasing a new and improved "Quit Kit" for 2012 which contains
addiction tests, nicotine patches and gum, wall planners and information to
help smokers to give up the expensive habit.

  1. ​![SUPPORT:  The NHS Quit Kit](http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/images/localpeople/ugc-images/275797/Article/images/14400365/3466407.png)

SUPPORT: The NHS Quit Kit

In addition to the Quit Kit, the NHS Smokefree website also features a "Quit
App" for iPhones and a cost calculator, allowing smokers to see exactly how
much their habit is costing them.

Dr Ruth Charlton, joint medical director at Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust,
said: "Making a serious commitment to quit smoking is one of the best single
things people can do, not only for their health but for that of the people
around them.

"It almost goes without saying that the other obvious benefit from quitting is
that it's a good move financially.

"Over the course of ten years, a person smoking 20 cigarettes a day will see
something in the region of £25,000 go up in smoke, quite literally."

Visit www.smokefree.nhs.uk or call the NHS Stop Smoking helpline free on 0800
0224332.
