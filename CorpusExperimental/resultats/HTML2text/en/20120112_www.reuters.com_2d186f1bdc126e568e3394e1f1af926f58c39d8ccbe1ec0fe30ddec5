CHICAGO | Mon Jan 9, 2012 5:13pm EST

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walgreen Co is going through "the worst" part of not being
in Express Scripts Inc's network and, while the transition is difficult now,
the drugstore should rebound as the year progresses, its top pharmacy
executive said on Monday.

Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, has been at odds with pharmacy
benefits manager Express Scripts since June, when the companies said they
could not agree on a new contract that would have started on January 1, 2012.
Now, after attempts to come to new terms were not fruitful, Walgreen no longer
fills prescriptions for Express Scripts' members, unless they choose to pay
another way.

"Right now is the worst part for us of not being in Express Scripts'
contract," Kermit Crawford, Walgreen's president of pharmacy, health and
wellness solutions and services, said as he walked around the company's newest
store in Chicago.

Walgreen asserts Express Scripts is focused only on drug spending and "that's
not how we think about healthcare," Crawford said.

Walgreen said it gave what was its best attempt at reaching an agreement back
in mid-December.

"As far as I'm concerned, the ball is in their court," Crawford added.

His chain says it wants to provide a more comprehensive approach to lowering
the overall cost of healthcare. That plan includes filling prescriptions -
what it is best known for - as well as services such as monitoring patients'
adherence to drug regimens, checking conditions such as diabetics' glucose
levels and offering in-store and workplace clinics.

The new Chicago store, in a spot that housed a Walgreens from 1926 until 2005,
features an updated pharmacy where a pharmacist sits at a desk near patients
rather than behind a high counter, along with two Take Care Health clinic
rooms.

While Walgreen has not spelled out exactly what rates it would accept from
Express Scripts, the chain is open to taking the rate is has with Medco Health
Solutions Inc. It also feels that it reached a "fair contract" with CVS
Caremark Corp back in 2010 after a brief dispute, Crawford said.

Express Scripts is in the process of trying to buy Medco, a deal that awaits
regulatory clearance.

Early trends in 2012 validate Express Scripts' belief that 95 percent of
prescription volume would continue without Walgreen, Chief Financial Officer
Jeff Hall said on Monday during a JPMorgan healthcare conference in San
Francisco.

Hall said that he does not want to negotiate the Walgreen dispute in the
public.

"We think cost has to go down. Walgreen thinks flat is good enough," he said.

Walgreen, for its part, said it offered to keep its rates flat for the next
three years.

Walgreen still expects to retain 97 percent to 99 percent of its 2011
prescription volume this year, Crawford said.

BREAD, WINE AND MANICURES

Across its more than 7,800 stores, Walgreen is busy trying to keep Express
Scripts' patients, including a January discount on its Prescription Savings
Club card membership.

Nearly 125,000 customers signed up for the card during the first week of
January, Walgreen said on Monday. Also, 122 payers have switched pharmacy
benefits providers or tweaked their Express Scripts contracts to allow them to
deal with Walgreen directly, said Crawford.

The new flagship store also shows how Walgreen is trying to become more of a
one-stop shop outside the pharmacy area. It houses a coffee bar with a
barista, a fruit and vegetable juice bar, desserts, including a frozen yogurt
station and a variety of produce, frozen food and wine. Walgreen has had
success with a similar Duane Reade store on Wall Street in New York that
opened in 2011.

The chain replicated some of the features from that store, such as a sushi bar
and small manicure salon, here on Chicago's State Street, just north of a
large Macy's Inc department store and across the street from a now-closed
Borders shop.

The new store, with 21,000 square feet of selling space, eclipses the size of
a typical Walgreens, at 11,000 to 13,000 square feet, said Chief Merchandising
Officer Bryan Pugh.

Upstairs, in the "Look Boutique," people can test light up mirrors and turn on
blow dryers to feel their power before they buy, Pugh said. Steps away, women
can get $10 manicures.

Downstairs, in the wine section, patrons can choose from more than 450
different types of wine, with bottles priced from $6.99 up to $449.99 for a
2006 Penfolds Grange.

Freshly-baked breads and a barista serving Metropolis coffee drinks are unique
to the store, Pugh said.

Shares of Walgreen, based near Chicago in Deerfield, Illinois, closed 1.27
percent higher at $33.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
