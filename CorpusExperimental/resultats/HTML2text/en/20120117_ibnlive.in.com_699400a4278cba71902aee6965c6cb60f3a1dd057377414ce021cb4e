# One dies of asphyxiation, two taken ill

PTI | 05:01 PM,Jan 17,2012

Phulbani (Odisha), Jan 17 (PTI) One person was asphyxiated in sleep and two
others were taken seriously ill after inhaling smoke from burning charcoal
kept in an earthen pot to get respite from the biting cold in Odisha's
Kandhamal district, police said today. The incident occurred last night at
Baliguda when the deceased Arakhita Patra (60), his wife Prafulla Patra and
son Nilachal were sleeping in the room. Other members of the family who were
sleeping in an adjacent room found the trio in an unconscious state in the
morning and immediately them to the local government hospital. Arakhita was
declared brought dead in the hospital. As severe cold wave is sweeping the
district for the last few days, charcoal fire is a common way to keep the
rooms warm at night. The fall in mercury level in almost every place to below
four degree celsius with layers of ice seen at Daringbadi where the
temperature had gone to minus two degree celsius last week had affected normal
life causing a lot of inconvenience to the people.
