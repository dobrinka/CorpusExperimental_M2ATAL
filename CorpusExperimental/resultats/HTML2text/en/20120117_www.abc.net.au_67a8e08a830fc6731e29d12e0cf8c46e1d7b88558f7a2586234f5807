# Chinese tree offers hope for alcohol antidote

Researchers say a Chinese tree offers hope for treating alcoholism.

  * **Map:** United States 

Researchers are investigating a 500-year-old Chinese hangover cure in the hope
they can put its properties into a pill to help alcoholics and stave off sore
heads.

The researchers say the ancient Chinese remedy contains a compound which can
prevent alcohol from having its usual intoxicating effects on the brain.

The compound, DHM, which works by stopping alcohol from accessing the
receptors in the brain, is extracted from an oriental raisin tree and has
already proved its worth as an alcohol antidote in a series of experiments on
rats.

Researchers at the University of California injected rats with a dose of
alcohol proportionate to the amount a human would get from downing 15 to 20
beers in two hours.

Head researcher Dr Jing Liang said "when rats are drunk they behave like
humans, just like that".

In a bid to test coordination and clumsiness, Dr Liang looked at how long rats
took to right themselves after being laid on their backs.

Rats treated with DHM took just five minutes to recover, while those without
the drug slept for more than an hour.

As well as sobering them up, the treated rats also exhibited fewer hangover
symptoms; for example, untreated rats were more likely to cower in the dark
recesses of their maze.

But Dr Liang says those dreaming of a magic antidote to drinking too much can
think again.

The presence of DHM also reduced the cravings for alcohol, a factor Dr Liang
says could prove invaluable in treating alcoholism in humans.

"If from the beginning you drink alcohol with DHM, you never go to a high
level of drinking," she said.

#### Direct antidote

Dr Paul Haber from Australia's National Alcohol and Drug Research Centre
welcomes the research.

He says the development of a drug with these properties for humans could
potentially save lives.

"A direct antidote might be useful in the emergency department setting where
people who are grossly intoxicated with alcohol sometimes are brought - Friday
night, Saturday night situations - and this might wake them up quickly so they
can go home," he said.

"We do have patients like this who wind up in intensive care and there are
deaths associated with direct alcohol poisoning."

#### Risks

Providing the drug is safe, effective and available, Dr Haber says there are
still risks associated with an alcohol antidote.

"Sometimes the antidote wears off too quickly," he said.

"It works for a while but then it wears off and the person becomes intoxicated
again, and if they have started driving home, for argument's sake, then
becoming intoxicated again can be life-threatening."

While a therapeutic drug may be some time away, Dr Liang is working on a
supplement that could potentially prevent alcohol addiction.

"You can take DHM with alcohol so you don't become addicted," she said.

Dr Haber says while potential drugs often falter in human trials, the DHM
discoveries are important.

"So even if this particular compound does not prove to be a safe and effective
treatment, it gives rise to a whole line of research into perhaps similar
compounds," he said.

Clinical trials on the effects of DHM on the human brain will begin soon.
