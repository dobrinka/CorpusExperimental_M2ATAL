Internet addiction has for the first time been linked with changes in the
brain similar to those seen in people addicted to alcohol, cocaine and
cannabis. In a groundbreaking study, researchers used MRI scanners to reveal
abnormalities in the brains of adolescents who spent many hours on the
internet, to the detriment of their social and personal lives. The finding
could throw light on other behavioural problems and lead to the development of
new approaches to treatment, researchers said.

An estimated 5 to 10 per cent of internet users are thought to be addicted –
meaning they are unable to control their use. The majority are games players
who become so absorbed in the activity they go without food or drink for long
periods and their education, work and relationships suffer.

Henrietta Bowden Jones, consultant psychiatrist at Imperial College, London,
who runs Britain's only NHS clinic for internet addicts and problem gamblers,
said: "The majority of people we see with serious internet addiction are
gamers – people who spend long hours in roles in various games that cause them
to disregard their obligations. I have seen people who stopped attending
university lectures, failed their degrees or their marriages broke down
because they were unable to emotionally connect with anything outside the
game."

Although most of the population was spending longer online, that was not
evidence of addiction, she said. "It is different. We are doing it because
modern life requires us to link up over the net in regard to jobs,
professional and social connections – but not in an obsessive way. When
someone comes to you and says they did not sleep last night because they spent
14 hours playing games, and it was the same the previous night, and they tried
to stop but they couldn't – you know they have a problem. It does tend to be
the gaming that catches people out."

Researchers in China scanned the brains of 17 adolescents diagnosed with
"internet addiction disorder" who had been referred to the Shanghai Mental
Health Centre, and compared the results with scans from 16 of their peers.

The results showed impairment of white matter fibres in the brain connecting
regions involved in emotional processing, attention, decision making and
cognitive control. Similar changes to the white matter have been observed in
other forms of addiction to substances such as alcohol and cocaine.

"The findings suggest that white matter integrity may serve as a potential new
treatment target in internet addiction disorder," they say in the online
journal Public Library of Science One. The authors acknowledge that they
cannot tell whether the brain changes are the cause or the consequence of the
internet addiction. It could be that young people with the brain changes
observed are more prone to becoming addicted.

Professor Michael Farrell, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research
Centre, University of New South Wales, Australia, said: "The limitations [of
this study] are that it is not controlled, and it's possible that illicit
drugs, alcohol or other caffeine-based stimulants might account for the
changes. The specificity of 'internet addiction disorder' is also
questionable."

**Case studies: Caught in the web**

**Xbox addict killed by blood clot after 12-hour sessions**

Chris Staniforth, 20, died of a blood clot after spending up to 12 hours at a
time playing on his Xbox. Despite having no history of ill health, he
developed deep vein thrombosis – commonly associated with long-haul flight
passengers. Mr Staniforth, from Sheffield, had been offered a place to study
game design at the University of Leicester. But he collapsed while telling a
friend he'd been having pains in his chest.

**Toddler starved to death while mother played online**

A mother was jailed for 25 years after her daughter starved to death while she
played an online game for hours at a time. Rebecca Colleen Christie, 28, from
New Mexico in the US, played the fantasy game World of Warcraft while her
three-year-old daughter, Brandi, starved. The toddler weighed just 23lbs when
she was finally rushed to hospital after her mother found her limp and
unconscious.

**Woman jailed after gamble fails to pay off**

A woman who stole £76,000 from a company to fund her internet gambling
addiction was jailed this week. Lucienne Mainey, 41, from Cambridgeshire, was
sentenced to 16 months in prison at Ipswich Crown Court after admitting fraud.
The court heard she secretly paid herself by changing old invoices. Mainey
turned to internet bingo following the breakdown of her marriage.
