# The Novartis Shutdown Could Cost How Much?

Image via Wikipedia

Over the past month, Novartis has worked hard to downplay the unexpected
shutdown of a key manufacturing plant in Lincoln, Nebraska, where the
drugmaker produces an assortment of widely used over-the-counter medicines and
animal health drugs. In announcing the closure, Novartis noted that combined
annual sales of the products made at the facility amount to less than 2
percent of Novartis group sales overall (see here).

But the unfolding drama - which includes a scathing report issued last summer
by FDA inspectors - may hurt more than the drugmaker would care to admit. In
fact, one Wall Street analyst projects that lost sales could amount to $560
million over the next 12 months.  Leerink Swann's Seamus Fernandez calculates
in an investor note that the missed opportunity to sell such stand-bys as
Excedrin, Bufferin and No-Doz represent about 25 percent of US consumer sales,
or about $390 million, not including another $170 million in incremental
sales, assuming the shutdown lasts only three months.

However, this does not include lost sales of animal health meds, such as the
big-selling Interceptor and Sentinel treatments for heartworm, or apparently
contract manufacturing. Endo Pharmaceuticals, for instance, reported that
prescription painkillers made at the facility wound up in some bottles for
other meds, although it remains unclear if these were OTC or prescription
(here is the FDA statement, in any event). And of course, the shutdown might
well last much longer.

The drugmaker, he notes, expects to meet with the FDA later this month, giving
Novartis execs an opportunity toprovide in time for the next earnings
announcement. Nonetheless, he notes that the suspension has the potential to
affect up to $1.1 billion in global sales. "History suggests that few
(manufacturing) challenges resolve quickly, but a partial resumption of
(manufacturing) is certainly possible, although a resumption of manufacturing
and a full recovery in the recalled brands are likely to take considerably
longer to resolve, particularly given the FDA’s involvement,” he then adds.

At this point, whether Novartis can avoid a lengthy shutdown is very unclear.
The problems the FDA cited in the inspection report were so disturbing that
the agency used capital letters and a bold font to emphasize that a pattern of
problems existed. These problems included failures to respond to consumer
complaints about bottles containing incorrect tablets, file reports with the
FDA or send postage-paid materials to consumers so that further evidence could
be examined (here is the FDA report).

The drugmaker did not help it cause by insisting the problems were beyond its
control, even though the FDA noted plant personnel failed to properly
investigate many complaints and could not present any evidence to justify its
conclusion. Moreover, the shutdown and subsequent recall came shortly after
the FDA sent a warning letter to Novartis about manufacturing problems at
three plants run by its Sandoz generic drug unit (look here). It's hard to
avoid the conclusion that the FDA is searching for system issues and still
other plants are going to be scrutinized.

The worst-case scenario is, in fact, a lengthy shutdown and possibly still
more, depending upon how the FDA proceeds. Then there is the prospect of a
consent decree. Remember that the FDA has pursued this step recently with
Johnson &amp; Johnson and Genzyme, and Wall Street is speculating that Hospira
is up next (more here). No one has suggested it may come to this, but the sort
of problems that Novartis has caused and FDA interest in multiple plants make
it likely the drugmaker will be preoccupied with manufacturing issues for
quite some time. And sales would have to take a hit.

Hi folks. My name is Ed Silverman and I've followed the pharmaceutical
industry since 1995. This ride began at The Star-Ledger of New Jersey and
continues with Pharmalot, which I have run since 2007. Along the way, I was
also an editor at The Pink Sheet. Before covering pharma, I worked for several
years at New York Newsday and, before that, at Investor's Daily, among other
places. I have a MA in journalism from New York University and a BS in
accounting from Binghamton University.
