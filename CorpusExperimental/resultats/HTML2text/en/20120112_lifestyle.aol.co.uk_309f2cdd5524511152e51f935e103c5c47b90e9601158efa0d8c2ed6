Workers in Britain are turning to the bottle and the fridge in a bid to beat
the boredom of their office jobs.  
  
The results of a new survey have shown that a quarter of staff in the country
binge on chocolates or high-calorie coffees, or drink too much after work.  
  
Researchers from the University of Central Lancashire surveyed 102 office
workers and found half said they had more chance of making mistakes if they
were bored.  
  
The research also found that 75% of workers admitted to losing concentration
if they were given a repetitive, uninteresting task to carry out.  
  
Researcher Dr Sandi Mann said "Managers might consider using boredom proneness
as a tool when selecting staff."  
  
"My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an
undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of
workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping."  
  
"This could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling
and empowerment. Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could
include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens."  
  
If you're always bored at work, it's worth bearing in mind the words of the
late Steve Jobs, who said in 2005: "You've got to find what you love...your
work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly
satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do
great work is to love what you do."

## Get fit at your desk

  * Arm wrestle a colleague

&lt;p&gt; Challenge your co-workers to an arm wrestling contest to boost your
arm strength. Do this three times a day and in a month's time you'll be giving
Popeye a run for his money.&lt;/p&gt;

![Arm wrestle a
colleague](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07/arm-
wrestling-women-getty.jpg)

  * Weights

&lt;p&gt; Keep a pair of light weights in your desk drawer for some impromptu
exercise. Try a few biceps curls while you're on the phone or strap on some
ankle weights and do 10 squats when you're on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

![Weights](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07/dumbells-
weights.jpg)

  * Leave your desk

&lt;p&gt; Studies show that long periods of sitting down can increase the risk
of serious diseases by 40%. Make sure you get up and do some exercises -
situps, pressups or jumping jacks - to get your circulation moving
again.&lt;/p&gt;

![Leave your desk](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07
/empty-desk-getty.jpg)

  * Stretch it out

&lt;p&gt; Using your computer can lead to RSI or back pain if you're not
vigilant. Make sure you stretch out your hands and arms regularly. Ask if your
office can host a weekly yoga class for a complete body stretch out.&lt;/p&gt;

![Stretch it out](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07
/stretch-hands-getty.jpg)

  * Don't send emails all the time

&lt;p&gt; When you want to talk to someone in your office, consider if you
could go and talk to them in person. This gets you out of your chair and is
more friendly than sending an email. It's even more effective if they don't
work on the same floor as you do and you have to take the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

![Don't send emails all the
time](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07/woman-sitting-
on-desk-getty.jpg)

  * Take the stairs

&lt;p&gt; Avoid your office lift and take the stairs. If your meeting room or
canteen is on the top floor, you'll tone your legs and burn calories running
up and down the stairs instead of standing still in a cramped lift.&lt;/p&gt;

![Take the stairs](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07
/woman-stairs-getty.jpg)

  * Get up

&lt;p&gt; Put something you regularly use - a mobile phone or stapler - a few
feet from your desk, so you have to get up to use it. While you're standing,
do a few lunges to strengthen your thighs and bum.&lt;/p&gt;

![Get up](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07/woman-desk-
tools-getty.jpg)

  * Have a desk disco

&lt;p&gt; Next time you feel you've been sitting still for too long, put on
your headphones and move around to your favourite high energy song. Pump your
arms, swing your head, jiggle about in your seat and loosen up - it all
counts!&lt;/p&gt;

![Have a desk disco](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07
/woman-music-desk-getty.jpg)

  * Move around

&lt;p&gt; Strap on a pedometer and set a target for the number of steps you
need to take while in the office. Offer to make the coffee, organise the
stationary cupboard and be the office busybody - it all helps keep you fitter
than sitting like a stone at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;

![Move around](http://www.blogcdn.com/lifestyle.aol.co.uk/media/2011/07/woman-
talking-colleague-getty.jpg)

  * Bike or walk to work

&lt;p&gt; The way you get to work can have a real impact on your general
fitness levels. Try cycling rather than using your car or public transport, or
get off the bus early and walk for 20 minutes before you get to your
desk.&lt;/p&gt;
