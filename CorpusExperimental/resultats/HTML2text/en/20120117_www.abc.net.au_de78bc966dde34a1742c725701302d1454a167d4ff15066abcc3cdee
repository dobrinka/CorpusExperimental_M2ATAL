# Counterfeit drugs threaten malaria control efforts

Counterfeit drugs may threaten efforts to control the spread of malaria.

Counterfeit drugs are threatening to sabotage breakthroughs in controlling
malaria, according to a new study funded by the United Kingdom's Wellcome
Trust.

The mosquito-borne disease kills about 800,000 people a year, mostly young
children and pregnant women in the developing world.

The latest and most effective treatment for malaria comes from a plant
originating in China known as artemisinin.

However, its effectiveness is being undermined by fake and poor-quality anti-
malarial drugs that are also being traced back to China and are flowing into
Africa and South East Asia.

One of the few studies looking into counterfeit malaria drugs has been
produced by the Wellcome Trust-Mahosot Hospital-Oxford University Tropical
Medicine Research Collaboration based in Laos.

"It's very difficult to give accurate numbers of the scale," research leader
Dr Paul Newton said.

"It's substantial, with hundreds of thousands of packets of fake anti-
malarials circulating."

Professor Alan Cowman from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Victoria
says counterfeit anti-malarial drugs are not only potentially harmful to the
individuals who consume them, but may also help the malaria parasite develop
an immunity to artemisinin.

"What the counterfeiters have done is basically watered down the level of drug
in the tablet and then they've added in other things that will have no effect
against that malaria parasite," said Professor Cowman, one of Australia's
leading malaria researchers.

"The parasite will be able to grow but it'll be in a lower concentration of
drug, not enough to kill it, but enough to enable it to get used to that level
of drug and therefore it makes it more likely that it will develop resistance
to that drug."

That is a huge problem when there are not that many drugs working well against
malaria.

#### Not immune

Dr Newton says in order to trace the origin of the counterfeit drugs, his
study looked at their pollen content and chemistry make-up and have handed
this information onto authorities.

"We've been using that information to inform governments so they will be able
to do their own criminal investigations," he said.

"That work is being done in collaboration with Interpol and it has succeeded
in cutting at least some of the trade in South East Asia."

The counterfeit drug market is difficult to control in many African and Asian
countries because pharmaceutical medicines are not distributed by governments
but sold privately.

Unfortunately, Australia is not immune to the counterfeit drug market.

Australian Pharmacy Guild national president Kos Sclavos says that with the
growth of online shopping, the use of counterfeits is on the rise.

"The reason it's on the rise is as people feel more comfortable with internet
shopping, it is expected that we'll see a rise in prescription shopping," he
said.

"There are items that are not on the PBS, such as private prescriptions,
generally drugs for lifestyle, drugs such as erectile dysfunctions or
medications that sadly patients are fully aware that they're not through the
normal supply chain.

"We're aware in the past where body-building steroids and the like have been
intercepted through the supply chain."

Mr Sclavos says consuming counterfeit drugs is like playing Russian roulette.
