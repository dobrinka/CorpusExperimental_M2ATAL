# RVH Critical Care Facility 'Topped Out'  
  
![RVH Critical Care Facility Topped Out](http://www.4ni.co.uk/newsimages/RVH-
Critical-Care-web.jpg)**There may be ongoing change on the way health and
social services are being delivered, but investment continues with a new
Critical Care Building nearing completion at the Royal Hospitals site in west
Belfast. **  
  
Speaking today, the NI Health Minister Edwin Poots has said all patients will
benefit from a new £152m state-of-the-art building, with modern fit for
purpose facilities.  
  
The Minister was speaking as he took part in a 'topping out' ceremony at the
new Critical Care Building at the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH).  
  
He said: "This new building is a much needed project and these new facilities
will benefit from the latest innovations in design and technology and provide
regional emergency and trauma services to some of the most severely injured
people in Northern Ireland."  
  
The first six floors of the building will include an emergency department,
main theatres and an adult critical care unit.  
  
The top three floors will house postnatal beds and maternity outpatients.  
  
DUP MLA and Executive Minister Poots added: "Along with a new maternity
building to include delivery theatres, antenatal beds, birthing rooms and a
neonatal unit, linked to the Critical Care Building, the construction will
also permit the delivery of first class regional maternity services in
Northern Ireland."

He added that construction of the Critical Care Building is due to be
completed in 2012, with the new linked Maternity building due for completion
in 2014. The proposed Children's hospital will be delivered as a separate
project.  
  
This is the third major project in the Royal Victoria Hospital redevelopment
programme. Phase 1, the main hospital building was completed in 2006 and Phase
2a, the Imaging Centre was completed in 2007.  
  
The investment comes at a time of dramatic change as it emerged on Tuesday
that a major review of the health service is at an advanced stage.  
  
Edwin Poots said the review, by John Compton, was expected to be the biggest
in recent years and has been forecast to be controversial and radical.  
  
The report's view is that it is likely only to be possible to provide
resilient, sustainable major acute services on five to seven sites.  
  
This is one of the 99 recommendations - and the one most likely to trigger
debate - as it means a huge reduction in the number of hospitals.  
  
The review suggests the current number could be cut from 10 as early as 2016
leaving as few as five - at worst - by that time.  
  
DUP Minister Edwin Poots said in the Assembly that 'Transforming Your Care, A
Review of Health and Social Care' contains a compelling set of proposals for
the future of health and social care services in Northern Ireland.  
  
However, it is at cost, as elsewhere, the SDLP South Down MLA Karen McKevitt
said any subsequent downgrading of the status of Daisy Hill in Newry as a
full-service acute hospital would make delivery of a coherent and consistent
health service impossible.  
  
Commenting on the Compton report which recommends cutting acute hospitals from
ten to five, she said: "It is very important that acute services and
particularly A&amp;E; are located on the basis of operational rather than
administrative requirements.  
  
"The consequences for my own constituency would be terrible as a glance at the
map will show. How on earth could A&amp;E; cover from Belfast or Craigavon
stretch out to Kilkeel or Attical?  
  
"Daisy Hill is in fact ideally placed to become the focal point of cross-
border co-operation on acute services and it is in that context that we need
to debate the reconfiguration of the health service," she said, yesterday.
