**The health minster has said there are people in Northern Ireland who are treating the health service as "some garage repair shop", on 14 December 2011.**

Edwin Poots told the health committee he believed there was "enough money in
the system to deal with people's needs, but not their abuse".

"Twenty-five per cent of people who call ambulances shouldn't and then we have
the others who eat themselves, drink themselves or smoke themselves into bad
health," he said.

Mr Poots was addressing the committee on the major health and social care
review which he brought to the assembly on Tuesday.

Health committee chair Michelle Gildernew gave "a guarded welcome" to the
report.

The DUP's Paula Bradley, who worked as a social work assistant for the
Northern Health and Social Care Trust before entering politics, said proposed
plans "will make such a difference" as the current health service was "not
workable for the patient".

A number of committee members expressed concerns over a planned reduction in
residential homes over the next five years.

John Compton, who carried out the report, said the need for residential care
was declining.

Edwin Poots said there would be more packages offered within the home and
therefore staff could be redeployed elsewhere. He said it was "more about
reconfiguration than redundancy".

Mr Poots added that the temporary closure of the Belfast City Hospital's
accident and emergency department in November had yielded positive results.

He said the number of 12-hour waits had dropped from a high of 89 in one month
when all three emergency units were open to just three in November following
the closure of the City unit.

He attributed this to better availability of registrars and other key staff.

Mr Compton also defended his plans to reduce the number of acute hospitals
from 10 to between five or seven saying elsewhere in UK there would only be
four acute hospitals covering a population the size of Northern Ireland.

During a discussion on consultant fees members expressed surprise that
information detailing individual bonuses had not been provided to committee
members by the department on request, despite similar information having been
released to media sources through freedom of information requests earlier in
the year.

The committee also took evidence on the health department's objectives for the
forthcoming Programme for Government, and the January monitoring round.
