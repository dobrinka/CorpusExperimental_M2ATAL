The Department of Health has refuted claims that it is planning to force
elderly people to pay £60,000 for care but remains open minded over
recommendations made by a working group.

Responding to reports that the department was considering a near doubling of a
proposed £35,000 cap on the amount the elderly or disabled pay for care, Paul
Burstow, the care services minister, said the matter was still under
consideration before the government's white paper in April.

"It is wrong to say we plan to force elderly people to pay £60,000 for care,"
Burstow said. "We are continuing to look at the whole system, which is
outdated, unfair and in urgent need of reform, and will set out our plans in
spring in the white paper."

A report from the Caring for our future group said in November 2011 that a cap
of between £50,000 and £60,000 on the lifetime cost of care would provide a
"tipping point" to "motivate and enable people to plan and prepare". It also
said working adults should use private insurance or equity from their homes to
cover future costs – a move that could expand the private insurance market.

A £60,000 cap would be a significant rise on "the most appropriate and fair
figure" of £35,000 recommended by the Dilnot Commission in July 2011. Andrew
Dilnot, the economist who led the commission, said a £35,000 cap could save
the state about £1.7m.

However, speaking to the social care network, Dilnot said he believed the
group's recommendations were "very positive" overall. He said the commission
had recommended a figure of between £25,000 and £50,000 but had chosen a mid-
way amount as the fairest. Dilnot said the working group had given a "top end"
figure, and that the benefit of having a cap would be greatly reduced if the
figure was much higher than £50,000.

Dilnot said that it was encouraging to see that the "financial services as a
whole were very enthusiastic and had bought into [more participation]" and
that the most important thing to come out of the working group was the need
for a cap.

"A relatively small group need high care costs. In other areas of our lives
risk is pooled but not here and that's what a cap does," he said. "There's a
terrifying lack of control. Once you no longer fear losing everything you can
put plans in place".

There is no current cap on care costs, with thousands relying on equity from
their homes to help meet high bills and many at risk of losing their homes.
Under the current system, those with assets of more than £23,250 have to meet
the full cost of a care home. The group recommended raising this threshold to
£100,000, after which individuals would be liable for full care costs.

Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's charity director, said the charity strongly
supported a cap on care. It said it supported the £35,000 figure recommended
by Dilnot. "After wide consultation and in-depth analysis, the Dilnot
Commission recommended a cap of £35,000 which Age UK believes would help
people to plan for their care needs and provide the certainty that might
encourage the financial services industry to introduce products that could
help in that planning process".

She added: "Inevitably any raising of the cap would mean that fewer people
would be helped by the move and for many it could lessen the incentive to
plan."

Considering the role of financial services in allowing people to plan for the
future, the working group's report said the government and others still needed
"to overcome mistrust in financial services which has been a major barrier".

The group also said a national campaign could also encourage people to prepare
for future care through pension schemes or investment in property, with
regular "awareness campaigns" to highlight the importance of planning. It said
that it would not encourage people to save specially for care but to
"accumulate generally for all costs associated with later life".

It said ministers would need to introduce clear rules on how to test the
eligibility of those needing help and there needed to be greater consistency
between authorities in assessment and eligibility for services.

Cross-party talks on how to fund the growing cost of care for the elderly and
disabled are due to start on Tuesday. Discussions will include the health
secretary Andrew Lansley, Paul Burstow, the Liberal Democrat state minister
for care services and Labour shadow secretary for health Andy Burnham.
