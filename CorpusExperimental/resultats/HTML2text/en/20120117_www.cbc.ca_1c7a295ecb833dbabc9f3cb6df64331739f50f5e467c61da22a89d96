# Selective abortions prompt call for ultrasound rules

### Canadian Medical Journal says new rules could curb female feticide in
certain groups

Gender selection in immigrants to Canada, National Bureau of Economic Research

A fetus's gender should not be revealed until after 30 weeks of pregnancy,
says an editorial in the Canadian Medical Journal.

This change in procedure for a fetal ultrasound, where the sex is usually
disclosed to parents at 20 weeks, would help prevent female feticide, says
Rajendra Kale, editor-in-chief of the CMAJ.

In Canada, doctors rarely perform abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy unless
the baby has a lethal fetal abnormality or the mother's life is in danger
because of the pregnancy.

Kale says that in countries such as India, China, Korea and Vietnam, female
fetuses are commonly aborted because of a preference for sons. Though by no
means widespread, the practice is carried out by some immigrants to Canada,
Kale says.

His editorial cites a small U.S. study of about 65 immigrant Indian women that
found 40 per cent had terminated earlier pregnancies, and 89 per cent pursued
abortions in their most recent pregnancies after learning they were having
girls. Previous Canadian research has suggested that sex selection is
occurring in Canada in certain groups when families have had girls and are
seeking a son.

The practice has created a gender imbalance in these communities.

"A pregnant woman being told the sex of the fetus at ultrasonography at a time
when an unquestioned abortion is possible is the starting point of female
feticide from a health-care perspective," writes Kale.

A study done in Canada found a distorted ratio of male to female births in the
Indo-Canadian community, particularly among couples that already have two
daughters.

"So clearly female feticide is happening, especially at the time of the third
child," Kale said.

In the editorial, Kale proposes postponing the disclosure of the gender, which
he called "medically irrelevant information" in most cases, until after about
30 weeks of pregnancy.

### Obstetricians group disagrees

Kale wants to see gender disclosure policies at 30 weeks adopted by the
provincial colleges that govern doctors. "Such clear direction from regulatory
bodies would be the most important step toward curbing female feticide in
Canada."

rajendra-220-cp.jpg)_People may try to get around the regulation but that's no
reason not to try, says Dr. Rajendra Kale._ _(CBC)_

The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada said Kale' s proposal
is inconsistent with their policy, which states that "a patient's request for
disclosure should be respected, either directly or in a report to the
referring health professional."

In an email to CBC News, the obstetricians group said it believes it is the
right of the patient to be informed of the gender of the fetus.

The editorial also did not consider tests on the market that give expectant
parents a fetal sex determination of high accuracy as early as eight weeks
into a pregnancy, the group notes.

People will always try to get around regulations but that's no reason not to
have them, Kale counters.

The obstetricians group says it doesn't condone abortions based on non-medical
reasons such as the gender of the fetus.

"The SOGC feels strongly that it is the cultural values and norms in specific
segments of the Canadian population that must change to ensure that females
are not confronted with procedures and intolerant environments before or after
they are born," the association said.

### Education call

Dr. Pargat Singh Bhurji, a pediatrician in Surrey, B.C., calls the practice of
female feticide barbaric.

"People [do] not want to come forward to talk about this," Bhurji said. "But
what I'm saying is this is definitely happening."

Couples can go to clinics in the U.S. that advertise early sex determination
in Indian newspapers, Bhurji notes. Cultural factors such as dowry and the
belief a boy is needed to carry the family name drive some, he adds.

The long-term goal has to be education, Bhurji says.

Dr. Samuel Soliman of the New Life Fertility Centre in Mississauga said some
patients have told him they've had abortions after having a girl or two.

"I think it is part of the whole spectrum of violence against women, which
starts from inside the uterus to the outside and the value of women," says
Soliman.

While the rule against disclosing gender might work in Canada, Soliman said,
it would not apply in the U.S., Soliman notes.
