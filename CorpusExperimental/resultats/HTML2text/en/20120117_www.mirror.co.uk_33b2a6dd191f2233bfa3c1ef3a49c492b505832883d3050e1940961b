#  HRT breast cancer link claims spark row

Experts have attacked claims hormone replacement therapy causes breast cancer.

The link between HRT and the disease was made in a 2003 Cancer Research UK-
funded report called the Million Women Study. It claimed the treatment doubles
a woman's breast cancer risk, while an update last August found "a rapid fall
in risk after HRT is stopped".

But experts writing in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health
Care insisted the Million Women Study did not prove there was a connection.

news;psect=news;zone=news;templ=page;gs_cat=GS_CHANNELS;tile=8;ord=818677566?)

The authors, from the UK, Germany and South Africa, said: "HRT may or may not
increase the risk of breast cancer but the Million Women Study did not
establish that it does."

They say their analysis uncovered flaws in the design of the Million Women
Study that would have skewed the findings.

For example, cancers detected within a few months of the study's start would
have already been present when the women were enrolled in the research - but
these were not excluded, they said.

In the third report from the Million Women Study, follow-up data on HRT use
was not available for 57% to 62% of the study participants. The researchers
added: "The name 'Million Women Study' implies an authority beyond criticism
or refutation.

"Many commentators, and the investigators, have repeatedly stressed that it
was the largest study of HRT and breast cancer ever conducted.

"Yet the validity of any study is dependent on the quality of its design,
execution, analysis and interpretation. Size alone does not guarantee that the
findings are reliable.

"If the evidence was unreliable, the only effect of its massive size would
have been to confer spurious statistical authority to doubtful findings."

Hazel Nunn, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, said: "Women
shouldn't be unduly worried by this latest review of HRT and breast cancer
risk.

"HRT can be an effective short-term treatment for menopausal symptoms \- women
taking it should try and use the lowest dose possible for as short a time as
they need it.

"If you are considering starting or stopping HRT, or using it for a long time,
you should discuss it with your doctor."

She added: "In the UK, HRT use has been falling since the start of the
millennium. Studies suggest that in 2005 there were 1,400 fewer cases of
breast cancer in the UK among women aged 50 to 59 than would have been if
there had been no drop in HRT use."

Professor Dame Valerie Beral, lead author on the Million Women Study, said the
issues raised by the latest research "are not new and have been refuted
previously".

"The authors omit to say that Million Women Study findings of an increased
risk of breast cancer in users of HRT, especially of oestrogen-progestogen
combinations, have been replicated in over 20 other studies. The totality of
the worldwide evidence is now overwhelming.  
  
"In line with the findings from these studies, the recent large decrease in
HRT use has been followed in many countries by a nationwide decline in the
incidence of breast cancer."
