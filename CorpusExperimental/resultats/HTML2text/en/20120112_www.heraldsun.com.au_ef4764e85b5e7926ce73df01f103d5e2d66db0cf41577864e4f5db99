#  Bee Gee launches brave fight against liver cancer

** BEE Gee Robin Gibb has turned to a team of alternative medics as he battles liver cancer. The singer was diagnosed with the disease last year.  **

He has received conventional treatment, including seven rounds of
chemotherapy. Doctors were pleased with his progress but Gibb decided to seek
other ways of recovery.

"Bee Gees star Robin Gibb has flown in a team of alternative medics from
Switzerland as he battles liver cancer," British newspaper _The Sun_ reported.

It is claimed the group is on hand to help Gibb 24 hours a day. The
"naturopath nutritionists" encourage him to eat foods that are good for the
body so it is as strong as possible as he fights the disease.

The star's wife Dwina reportedly asked her husband to speak to the
professionals as she is a big believer in natural medication.

It is believed Gibb, 62, has also been spending time in a special detox hut
where he sweats and loses toxins.

"Robin is fighting this with dignity and courage. He's trying everything
possible to beat this disease," an insider said.

Gibb's diagnosis was first reported in November and came after the musician
was seen looking increasingly frail in public.

Soon after his diagnosis was reported, Gibb posted a message on his website
reassuring fans he was doing well. "I have been very unwell and am now on the
road to recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me," he
wrote.

"I believe because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you
all."
