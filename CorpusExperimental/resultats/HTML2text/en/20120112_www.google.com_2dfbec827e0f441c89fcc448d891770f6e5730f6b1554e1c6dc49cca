£200m boost for compensation fund

(UKPA) - 10 hours ago

Nearly £200 million has been pumped into a pot for NHS compensation payouts,
the Department of Health said.

Claims have increased in recent years as a result of no-win, no-fee lawyers,
and the NHS Litigation Authority has been left short of cash.

Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, was forced to inject £185 million into
the fund until April after fears the money would run out.

Government figures show the maximum possible negligence payouts faced by the
NHS if all cases were lost, rose from £5.31 billion in 2001 to £16.85 billion
last March, The Times reported. Annual payouts grew from £277 million in
2000-01 to nearly £1 billion in 2010-11. In the past five years, clinical
negligence claims have risen from 5,697 to 8,655 per year, according to the
newspaper.

The Department for Health joined the the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in support
of "ambitious proposals" to clamp down on "claimant farmers", who encourage
patients to sue for negligence.

Health Minister Lord Howe said: "Following a review of claims, we have made
additional funds available to the NHS Litigation Authority in order to make
sure that those claimants who are entitled to compensation receive it in a
timely way. We want to strike the right balance between access to compensation
claims and ensuring that costs are proportionate, sustainable and affordable."

A spokesman for the MoJ added: "The claimant lawyers are making a packet as
are the claimant farmers."

Tom Fothergill, financial director of the NHS Litigation Authority, told The
Times no-win, no-fee lawyers had added a hefty premium to costs, as well as a
legal ruling five years ago that linked the wages of claimants' carers to
earnings rather than inflation.

The Government is pressing ahead with plans to reform the civil litigation
funding and costs system in England and Wales after vowing to restore common
sense to the system.

The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, is currently
before the Lords. Under the proposals claimants will pay their lawyer's
success fee out of their damages, rather than the defendants and there will be
a 10% increase in general damages for claimants as well as a mechanism to
protect the vast majority of personal injury claimants from paying a winning
defendant's costs.
