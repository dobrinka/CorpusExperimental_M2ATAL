ABC News' Ben Waldron reports:

A Bronx man says he nearly had an asthma attack after opening his mail to find
a $44 million medical bill from a local hospital.

Unemployed doorman Alexis Rodriguez, 28, received the astronomical bill after
receiving successful treatment for pneumonia at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital last
week, The New York Daily News reports.

"I almost had an asthma attack," said Rodriguez, who apparently is not the
only patient to receive an outsized bill. The firm responsible for the botched
billing, PHY Services, was reportedly inundated with complaints and has since
apologized.

"If you are calling with respect the billing statement for services provided
at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement," said a recording
for concerned callers, "you will be receiving a new statement shortly."

PHY is blaming the mistake on a "system error" that resulted in the bill's
invoice number being mistakenly placed in the "amount due" field.

As for Rodriguez, he owes no more than $300 for outpatient services.

Man - hospitals are out of control with their prices. How will anyone be able
to pay these ridiculous bills? More and more are uninsured because their
companies cannot afford healthcare and those that have it find that it is
unsatisfactory in many ways. Co-insurance and deductibles are squeezing
consumers who can barely afford their mortgages or rents let alone $3,000 and
up yearly deductibles. Romney wants to appeal Obamacare but premiums will end
up going up 25% in that case. The free market is clearly not a solution and
healthcare is quickly becoming rationed. The US is broke. We need to do
something quickly.

“PHY is blaming the mistake on a “system error” that resulted in the bill’s
invoice number being mistakenly placed in the “amount due” field.” Hummmm,
First of all started with the Programmer’s error that wrote bad code; secondly
is no test had been performed to ensure the change made to the billing
application was checked and verified for its correctness before the modified
application been promoted to production. This amounts to a company’s
recklessness manifested in many levels of management – for one - It appeared
that the company hired poor-quality software engineer(s) and the embarrassing
result shown in media limelight. And I know what I’m talking about because
I’ve more than 30 years of programming and working experience to back it up.

Guys, this was a billing error, nothing more. "PHY is blaming the mistake on a
“system error” that resulted in the bill’s invoice number being mistakenly
placed in the “amount due” field."

The problem could be software related or PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between the
Keyboard And Chair) related due to the user. I have written medical form
software in the past. Medical forms in software need to be beyond bullet-proof
and the QA team needs to try as many crazy combinations or errors as possible.
Even then, sometimes bad data passes through the software to the system. One
example was when a health insurance client asked why there was apparently
unrelated text in the notes field of a medical form. The problem was that the
agent copy and pasted an Olive Garden recipe from a web browser into the notes
field in the medical form. Since the client asked about the details of the
text and the recipe was incomplete, I sent the URL to the recipe and the full
description of the recipe to the client. :-)

if they bill you or the insurance companies this munch, it can be easily raise
question and found that is is an error from human or system. imagine that you
are fully taken care by your government for the care and the bill is sent to
uncle sam, who is going to audit all this types of transactions ? if a human
makes error, the system can catch it; if a system makes error, the human can
catch it; but if both human AND system make error by design, who is going to
audit and catch it ??? that is one of the real reason that is why prices,
premiums, and taxes are never enough ! if it can happen to you, it can happen
to others; and vice versa, if it happen to others, it can happen to you too.
in a free market where competitions exist, one has the right to choose and to
buy; but in a control market where only limited stuffs exist, one has to pay
more monetarily and rights !

Was this a mistake? I have heard of more and more companies overbilling, and
then apologizing and setting the bill right after being "caught." There has to
be a number of others, probably elderly, who don't notice the change, and end
up paying the amount. This could be yet one more way of deceiving the public
to boost income. It could be yet one more scheme to defraud the public without
anyone watching, without any consequences.
