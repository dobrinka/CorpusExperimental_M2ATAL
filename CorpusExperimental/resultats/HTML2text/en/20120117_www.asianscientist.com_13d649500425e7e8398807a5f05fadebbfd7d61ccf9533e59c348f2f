  * _AsianScientist (Jan. 17, 2012)_ - India, once recognized as the world’s epicenter of polio, appears to have interrupted wild poliovirus transmission, completing one year without polio since its last case, in a two-year-old girl in the state of West Bengal, on January 13, 2011. 

The number of polio-endemic countries, those which have never stopped
indigenous wild poliovirus transmission, will then be reduced to a historical
low of three: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

In 2011, Afghanistan and Pakistan both saw alarming increases in polio cases,
and poliovirus from Pakistan re-infected China (which had been polio-free
since 1999). In Africa, active polio transmission continues in Chad, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nigeria.

The scale of the eradication effort in India is mind-boggling: each year, more
than 170 million children under the age of five are vaccinated in two national
immunization campaigns, with up to 70 million children in the highest-risk
areas vaccinated multiple times in additional special campaigns; the whole
effort requires nearly a billion doses of oral polio vaccine annually.

By 2013, India will have contributed US$2 billion to polio eradication in the
country, with it being a largely self-financed effort.

> "India’s success is arguably its greatest public health achievement and has
provided a global opportunity to push for the end of polio," said WHO
Director-General Margaret Chan.

>

> “Stopping polio in India required creativity, perseverance and
professionalism – many of the innovations in polio eradication were sparked by
the challenges in India. The lessons from India must now be adapted and
implemented through emergency actions to finish polio everywhere,” Chan said.

Rotary International first launched the global polio eradication effort in
1985, and RI President Kalyan Banerjee said that with the intensity of
transmission in India, many experts had predicted it would be the last country
in the world to achieve eradication.

> “India is undoubtedly the biggest domino to fall in the polio eradication
effort,” he said.

However, there remains no room for complacency, said the Director of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Thomas Frieden. India must
maintain sensitive surveillance and high childhood immunity against wild
poliovirus to guard against any importation of polio until eradication is
achieved globally.

> “Polio can be stopped when countries combine the right elements – political
will, quality immunization campaigns, and an entire nation’s determination,”
said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

>

> “World leaders must continue to raise the funds needed to run the global
campaign and help to ensure that no child suffers from this crippling disease
ever again,” Gates said.
