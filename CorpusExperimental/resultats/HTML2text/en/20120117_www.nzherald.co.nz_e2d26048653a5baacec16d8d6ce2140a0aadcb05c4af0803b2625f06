A Gisborne man is in hospital with moderate burns after a cigarette ignited
fumes from an open can of methylated spirits.

The 26-year-old was working in a shed at the back of his property in the
suburb of Kaiti earlier this afternoon.

He suffered burns to his right leg and arm.

The Fire Service says the cigarette lit a shade cloth and a couch in the shed.

They say it shows just how important it is to take care when lighting
cigarettes around flammable liquids.
