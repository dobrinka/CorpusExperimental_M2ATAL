# Patients die or suffer harm in 10% of NHS safety mishaps

  * by Madeleine Brindley, WalesOnline

Surgical instruments

Almost one in 10 patient safety incidents in the NHS Wales results in
significant harm to patients, new figures show.

The reports, which cover the six months between April and September last year,
show there were 55 deaths and 68 incidents of "severe harm" to patients in
health boards and NHS trusts in Wales from such incidents.

In some parts of the NHS the number of deaths and incidents of severe harm
have risen steeply in the last six months.

Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, has called on Health
Minister Lesley Griffiths to investigate relatively high death rates in some
health boards.

According to reports submitted to the National Patient Safety Agency, more
than 40 patients have died in patient safety incidents at Betsi Cadwaladr
University Health Board in the course of 18 months and there were almost 30
deaths at both Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board and Hywel Dda
Health Board, in the same period.

An investigation was launched into a reported 41 deaths at Aneurin Bevan
Health Board between April and September and it resulted in the figure being
revised to 18.

Ms Williams said: "It is accepted that some patients will die in hospitals,
but it is unacceptable that patients die due to hospital error.

"In the last two years, more than 40 patients have died unnecessarily under
the care of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. Surely that statistic
is alarming enough to warrant an investigation?

"If the health boards can learn from their mistakes, they can reduce the
number of people who die needlessly in our NHS.

"Patient safety and welfare is paramount, which is why I have written to the
Health Minister demanding that she looks into this issue with a matter of
urgency. This is clearly a systematic problem that the Labour Government needs
to address."

The figures also raise concerns about whether health boards are reporting all
incidents as Powys Local Health Board said there had been just one between
April and September last year.

But in the previous six months, the health board had reported 264 incidents,
including one which resulted in the death of a patient.

A spokesman for Powys Local Health Board said: "There has clearly been an
error in the data published. We are looking into the process of preparing and
uploading this data to identify the error. Once this is complete we will
ensure that the report is corrected as soon as possible."

Overall, the April to September 2011 figures show there were 26,749 reported
incidents, a 9% drop on the previous six-month period. The vast majority of
these incidents - 91% - resulted in no or "low" harm to a patient.

A Welsh Government spokesman said: "Every year, thousands of patients receive
high quality, safe and effective treatment, but in a modern health system -
where increasingly complicated procedures are being undertaken - sadly,
mistakes can, and will, still happen.

"When this happens, the NHS must investigate and take action, where
appropriate, and provide assurances and feedback to patients.

"As the figures show, the overwhelming majority of incidents result in no harm
to patients. It is important every incident, no matter how small or serious,
is reported to ensure they can be investigated and measures put in place to
reduce the risk of them happening again.

"We encourage high reporting as this provides organisations with more
opportunities to learn from incidents and improve safety.

"We know from research that high reporting is a positive indicator of an open
and supportive safety culture.

"The 1,000 Lives campaign saved an additional 1,199 lives in Welsh healthcare
and staff continue to deliver major improvements on critical care wards, in
operating theatres and in the community, including the reduction of pressure
ulcers and healthcare associated infections."
