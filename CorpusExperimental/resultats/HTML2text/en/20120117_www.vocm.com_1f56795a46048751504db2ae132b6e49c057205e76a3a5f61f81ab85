The Department of Health and Community Services is reminding residents that
seasonal flu vaccinations are still available throughout the province. The
free shots can be obtained through your family doctor or public health office.
High-risk adults and children with chronic disease, persons in care and older
than 60, aboriginal persons, health care workers, pregnant women, and poultry
and swine industry workers are at increased risk for influenza.

Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Faith Stratton, reminds all residents to clean,
cover and contain when coughing or sneezing, in order to minimize infectious
transmission.
