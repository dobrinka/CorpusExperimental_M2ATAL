# Star Princess Turned Away from Falklands Due to Noro-Virus

**_Star Princess_** was turned away from calling at **Port Stanley** in the **Falkland Islands** on Saturday, because the government said it was unprepared to deal with a noro-virus outbreak and had limited resources to deal with such a situation.

**Princess Cruises**' spokeswoman **Julie Benson** called the government's response "totally unwarranted." No Princess ship has ever been denied entry into a port based on incidences of ill passengers and crew onboard, she said.

Noro-virus is essentially the stomach flu; symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting
are often severe but usually disappear within 48 hours. Except for the
elderly, young children or those with severe medical issues, the virus usually
is harmless. Over the past few years, cruise lines have a well-established
protocol for dealing with cases of noro-virus onboard ships.

Health groups, such as the **U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**
and **Britain**'s **Health Protection Agency**, generally encourage ports to
offer support to vessels arriving with ill people. In addition, only 74
passengers and crew (about two percent of those on board) had been reported
ill; that's below the three percent level the CDC considers as an outbreak.
The Falklands' chief medical officer made the decision after consulting with a
U.K. microbiologist.

"An outbreak in the Falkland Islands would put enormous pressure on our
limited medical resources, and jeopardize other scheduled cruise visits," a
government statement said. Politically speaking, **Argentina** and the U.K. -
long adversaries for control of the remote islands off the coast of **South
America** - are in the midst of a diplomatic row. Argentina calls the
Falklands by a different name, the **Malvinas**. The two countries went
briefly to war over the islands in 1982, with the British maintaining control.
Now, **Brazil**, **Chile** and **Uruguay** are supporting Argentina by turning
away ships flying the Falklands flag. Apparently many citizens of those
countries were passengers on _Star Princess. _ Today, January 17, _Star
Princess _calls in **Buenos Aires**, Argentina. The 14-day cruise ends Jan.
21.
