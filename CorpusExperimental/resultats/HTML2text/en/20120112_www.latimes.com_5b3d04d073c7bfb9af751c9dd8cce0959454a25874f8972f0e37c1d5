By Shari Roan, Los Angeles Times / For the Booster Shots blog

January 11, 2012, 3:48 p.m.

The number of embryos transferred during in vitro fertilization has been a
controversial topic for many years because multiple births are linked to much
higher rates of medical problems for both mothers and babies as well as huge
healthcare costs.  
  
A study published Wednesday, one the largest analyses on the issue, concluded
that doctors can consider transferring two embryos in some women but that
there is no justification for transferring three or more embryos in any
patient.  
  
Several countries have already enacted legislation to bar transfers of two or
more embryos -- or more than one embryo among women who have a good chance of
pregnancy. In the United States, reproductive health leaders have also voiced
support for transfers of only one or two embryos depending on the woman's
prognosis. However, the guidelines are voluntary. And although the popularity
of multiple-embryo transfers has fallen, as recently as a few years ago, 40%
of IVF treatment cycles in the U.S. involved transfer of at least three
embryos, according to the authors of the new study.  
  
The study, appearing online in the journal Lancet, analyzes 124,148 IVF cycles
in the United Kingdom, comparing the number of embryos transferred to patient
age and other characteristics and rates of live births.  
  
Not surprisingly, the live birth rate was greater in both women younger than
40 and women 40 and older when two embryos were transferred compared with one.
However, the transfer of three embryos resulted in a lower live birth rate in
the younger women compared with transferring two. And, among women 40 and
older, the transfer of three embryos resulted in a live birth rate similar to
two-embryo transfers.  
  
The study confirmed that the risk of preterm birth was much higher when three
embryos were transferred.  
  
"A clear implication of our study, therefore, is that transfer of three
embryos should no longer be supported in women of any age," the authors wrote.  
  
U.S. doctors, patients and policy-makers should take special note of the
findings, Dr. Liv Bente Romundstad, a reproductive health specialist at St.
Olav's University Hospital in Norway, said in a commentary accompanying the
study.  
  
"Preterm deliveries that result from multiple pregnancies after assisted
conception add a substantial financial burden to healthcare; in the USA, the
annual cost is estimated to be around $1 billion," she wrote.
