# New UEA diabetes study into womenâs diet and heart disease hailed as a
âsignificantâ success

By RICHARD WOOD Monday, January 16, 2012  
12:01 AM

A PIONEERING new study has shown that eating more flavonoids can potentially
reduce the risk of heart disease for women with diabetes.

The study, led by the University of East Anglia (UEA), investigated the impact
of the natural compound on postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes and found
that eating certain foods seemed to reduce the risk of heart attacks and
strokes.

A total of 93 women took part in the project to look particularly at the
impact of flavonoids â a naturally occurring compound that occurs in foods
and drinks including many fruits and vegetables, tea, red wine and dark
chocolate.

Previous studies have seen that flavonoids reduce the risk of heart disease in
healthy people, but this project, funded by Diabetes UK, was the first long-
term study on a group labelled as very high risk to heart disease.

For a period of 12 months, the women, aged from 51 to 74, were given either a
flavonoid-enriched chocolate or a normal sugar-free chocolate bar twice a day
they believed would help. They were also required to regular their other
flavonoid intake, for example by peeling apples before eating them.

Those eating the adapted bar saw their risk of suffering a heart attack in the
next decade fall by 3.4pc, while their insulin resistance and cholesterol
levels were significantly reduced.

Lead researcher Prof Aedin Cassidy, from the UEA, said: âThese results are
significant from a public health perspective because they provide further
concrete evidence that diet has a beneficial clinical effect over and above
conventional drug treatment.â

However, she said that she was not advocating eating more commercially
available chocolate because many commercial chocolates do not contain high
levels of the beneficial flavonoids.

Dr Ketan Dhatariya, one of the researchers and a consultant in diabetes at the
Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, added: âThis is an important
result. We are not saying that people with diabetes should be eating lots of
chocolate, but that foods that are rich in flavonoids can potentially reduce
the risk of heart attacks and strokes, which sadly remain the leading causes
of premature death in this group of women.â

The findings have been printed in the journal Diabetes Care and further
research is now planned to examine the impact on other patient groups.

CASE STUDY:

One of the women taking part in the study was Cindy Greenway, 64, of Denton,
near Harleston in Norfolk.

Mrs Greenway was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of 41, and after
dealing with it for more than 20 years, she is a firm believer that âfood is
medicineâ.

She said she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes after feeling tired and
lethargic over a period of months, but was keen to go on without insulin.

Mrs Greenway, a grandmother, said: âI really did become very interested in
food and the fact that food has such an important part of gaining a good
control of oneâs diabetic condition.

âI did not want to go on to insulin and I explored and researched different
aspects of food and the impact on the body, and with guidance I did embark on
a very healthy regime of exercise and diet.â

Mrs Greenway spent between 30 minutes and an hour a day either walking,
swimming and cycling, and started to eat 70pc raw food, giving up sweets,
chocolates, biscuits and cake.

Although she does now take four insulin injections a day, she continues to go
without the sweets many people enjoy but says she doesnât miss them at all
and as a result is very healthy.

She added that her ultimate decision to take insulin was not taken lightly and
was an important one.

She said: âIf diabetes is not controlled it can be serious and it can lead
to heart conditions and is the biggest cause of blindness and circulation
problems.

âSo I think it is in my interest to try to control the situation as much as
I can, and I do find the more control I have the more energy I have, which is
very important to living a normal life.â

  * New Year can be a very good reason for everyone who wants to start a healthy lifestyle. For those who want to lose weight is very important to find a healthy weight loss program that really works. My best friend had very good results with a diet program from TIPSTODIET.COM. She lost 40 lbs and still maintain this weight. Good luck to everyone!

  * ***Food Chemicals are the cause of the diabetes and obesity crisis****. This is of course nonsense , an idea promoted as stated below by a" film maker" with no medical or relevant qualifications. You will not be surprised to learn that a fee is charged to learn the secrets of this magical diet cure. There is one born every minute.

  * *** was the first long-term study on a group labelled as very high risk to heart disease***. So its not " old news " or " already well known " . Diabetes UK is charity and is hardly likely to throw its money at pointless research , and is rather more likely than you to know what is " old news " or " already well known ". We look forward to hearing what Margery and Z:) have to say.

  * This really is old news, as it has been known for donkey's years that a good diet including plenty of fruit and veg, coupled with a moderate amount exercise and a healthy lifestyle gives one some protection from a whole range of illnesses including heart disease. Every so often these researchers try to justify what they are doing by recycling what really is already well known.
