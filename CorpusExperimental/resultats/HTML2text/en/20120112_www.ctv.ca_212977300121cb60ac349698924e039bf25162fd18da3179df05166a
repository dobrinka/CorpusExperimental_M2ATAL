Robin Gibb has flown in a team of alternative medics from Switzerland to help
him fight liver cancer.

The Bee Gees star has undergone seven rounds of chemotherapy in his bid to
beat the disease and he is now receiving 24-hour care from naturopath
nutritionists - which are thought to be the idea of his wife Dwina - at his
home in Thame, Oxfordshire.

As well as the naturopathic approach - which relies on the body's ability to
heal itself through good nutrition, rather than relying on surgery and drugs -
Dwina has encouraged the singer to have 20-minute detox sessions.

A close family friend told the British _The Sun_ newspaper: "Robin is fighting
this with dignity and courage. He's trying everything possible to beat this
disease."

In November 2011, Robin - who is a teetotal vegan - revealed details on his
battle with liver cancer, which was diagnosed in April.

At the time, he said: "I have been very unwell and am now on the road to
recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me. I believe
because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you all."

The diagnosis came as a massive blow to Robin after he thought "everything had
gone back to normal" following his successful treatment for an intestinal
blockage in 2010.

Speaking of the ordeal, he explained: "All this time I'd thought it was wind
cramps. But the surgeon said that was typical of the way it manifests. The
blockage was so bad that he was surprised it hadn't burst the day before, but
it was too dangerous to delay any longer.

"The relief was enormous, and afterwards I needed no painkillers. Not even an
aspirin. I have a vegetarian diet, and a great appetite. Everything seemed to
go back to normal."
