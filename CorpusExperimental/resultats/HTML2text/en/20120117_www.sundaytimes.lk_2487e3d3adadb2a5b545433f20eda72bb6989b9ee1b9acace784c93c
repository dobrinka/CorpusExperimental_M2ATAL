# Dengue: Paediatricians College warn parents  
  
---  
By Kumudini Hettiarachchi  
  
As the spectre of a dengue epidemic loomed large, the Sri Lanka College of
Paediatricians warned parents and doctors not to give children common pain-
relieving medication.

The Health Ministry's Epidemiology Unit reported that within the first 13 days
of this year, there were as many as 674 dengue patients hospitalised with five
deaths across the country. In this backdrop, the Sri Lanka College of
Paediatricians has identified certain medications as being harmful and leading
to bleeding in children.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen,
mefenamic acid and diclofenac sodium suppositories should not be given to
children with fever prior to admission to hospital, urged Prof.

Asvini Fernando, President of the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians,
pointing out that it is advisable to use only paracetamol at the recommended
doses to bring down the fever, along with sponging the child with lukewarm
water.

In a formal message to all parents, the College of Paediatricians said, "it is
well documented that children who have had these medicines have a greater
potential to bleed when they have Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)" and advised
parents to refrain from giving their children these medications if they have
fever.

Explaining that paediatric wards in most parts of the country are dealing with
a large number of children with Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Haemorrhagic
Fever (DHF), Prof. Fernando said it had been noted that some of these children
had received these medications before admission to hospital.

These drugs (NSAIDs) are available in the market under different trade names.
Hence it is important to check the labels of all medications available for
control of fever, prior to giving them to your child, she said.

Echoing the views of the paediatricians, an Epidemiology Unit official said
parents should not panic and dose the child with these common pain-relieving
drugs. "It is essential to rule out dengue whenever a child has fever," the
official said, explaining that the fever is only a symptom of the disease.
Referring to the harmful effects of giving pain-relieving drugs if the child
is having dengue, the official said such drugs might erode the lining of the
stomach.

By nature, these medications also have anti-clotting properties. As such
NSAIDs in any form, be it tablets, liquids, suppositories or injections,
should not be given for fever as dengue is raising its head once again, the
official said.

Meanwhile, senior Consultant-Paediatrician, Dr. LakKumar Fernando who is also
a dengue specialist said that looking at the trend last year, usually among
those affected by dengue about 50% would be children. Last year, among the
dengue deaths, one-third comprised children and two-third adults.

Adding his voice to the serious concerns expressed over the use of NSAIDs when
dengue is rampant, he pointed out that the guidelines for dengue management
formally introduced by the Health Ministry in December 2010 specifically
advised against their use. If any child has fever, the first assumption should
be that it is dengue, as this viral disease is now hyper-endemic in Sri Lanka,
he says.

A few years ago if we saw 10 children with fever, about 2-3 would be dengue
patients. But now in Colombo, of 10 children with fever, we should suspect
that five have dengue, while in Negombo it would be as high as eight, said Dr.
Fernando who is based in Negombo.

Being part of a team which has studied dengue management not only in Thailand
but also helped implement such measures in Pakistan recently, he said that
when called upon to advise paediatricians all over the country on managing
very ill children he had come across many who had bled due to being given
either ibuprofen or mefenamic acid before admission to hospital. "When dengue
is around us, don't give NSAIDs to bring down the fever," he said, even though
fever could be a distressing symptom and parents may look for quick relief.
For, NSAIDs would then do more harm than good.

Explaining that dengue patients die due to prolonged shock, fluid overload or
massive bleeding, Dr. Fernando added the cause of death in a large proportion
of patients was massive bleeding.  
Currently while the Colombo and Gampaha districts of the Western Province are
the worst-hit with dengue, increased numbers are also being recorded in Kandy,
Puttalam, Batticaloa, Kurunegala and Galle, the Sunday Times learns.

Last week, the Sunday Times reported (city edition) that Negombo was in the
throes of a dengue epidemic with at least 75 patients, both children and
adults, being treated at the Negombo Hospital on any given day.
