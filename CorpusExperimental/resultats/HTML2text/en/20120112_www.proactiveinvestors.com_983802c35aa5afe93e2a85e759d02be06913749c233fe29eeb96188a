# Hemispherx Biopharma shares rise on FDA extension of new drug application

Hemispherx BioPharma (AMEX:HEB) shares rose on Wednesday after announcing that
the FDA granted an extension for the company to modify its new drug
application (NDA) for Ampligen, a potential treatment for chronic fatigue
syndrome (CFS).

The modification to the NDA is in response to the complete response letter
received by the company in November 2009 for the CFS therapeutic indication.

The extension will remain open while Hemispherx submits an amended NDA, the
company said.

Last year, a team of researchers at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and
Harvard University reported new data on the magnitude of the medical and
economic impact of untreated CFS.

In its statement, Hemispherx cited that according to the study, "CFS patients,
their families, employers and society bear significant costs associated with
the illness. The symptoms characterizing CFS are common to many illnesses,
hence diagnosis is complex… and requiring extensive diagnostic testing and
clinical assessment."

In the request for extension, the company said it advised the FDA of the
findings presented at the IACFS/ME Biennial Scientific Conference held in
September of last year in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, of a new potential
companion diagnostic test for CFS.

"We continue to move forward and are working diligently to pursue approval for
Ampligen® as the first treatment for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in the U.S. and
other countries," said chief medical director of Hemispherx, Dr. David
Strayer.

Ampligen is an experimental RNA nucleic acid being developed for debilitating
diseases and disorders of the immune system.

Shares of the company jumped over 14 percent to trade at 24 cents near market
close on Wednesday.
