# Assisted suicide: GMC to draw up new advice

Medical regulators are considering how to deal with allegations that doctors
have helped people kill themselves after a patient asked them what support, if
any, doctors could give to people considering ending their own lives.

The General Medical Council (GMC) says doctors are already bound by the law
that assisting or encouraging suicide remains a criminal offence but believes
it needs to clarify how its own investigators deal with cases where no
prosecution is mounted but complaints are still made about a doctor's fitness
to practise.

More than 150 Britons have travelled to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich,
Switzerland, to end their own lives. A GMC working group is drafting internal
guidance for decision-makers on fitness to practise cases before putting it
out for public consultation late next month.

Niall Dickson, the GMC's chief executive, said: "The issue of assisted suicide
is complex and sensitive. We already have clear guidance for doctors that they
must always act within the law and assisting or encouraging suicide remains a
criminal offence. This guidance will not in any way change the legal position
for doctors. It is not our role to take a position on whether or not the law
should be changed; that is a matter for the relevant legislature.

"We recognise however that there are a range of actions which could be
considered as assisting in a suicide, such as providing information to a
patient about suicide or providing practical assistance for someone to travel
to a clinic such as Dignitas. Some of these actions may not lead to criminal
charges but may still lead to complaints to us about a doctor's fitness to
practise.

"We therefore think our decision-makers will find it useful to have guidance
about the factors they should consider when dealing with an allegation that a
doctor has assisted a person to commit suicide. Doctors, patients and others
may also find it helpful if we set out clearly how we will consider complaints
in this area."

The GMC says it has only considered three cases involving allegations relating
to doctors assisting in a death in the past 10 years. One resulted from a
conviction for assisting suicide in Canada and none from any conviction in the
UK.

There have been no prosecutions of anyone alleged to have assisted suicide in
England and Wales since the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer,
issued a new policy framework for prosecutors in February 2010. This came
after Debbie Purdy, who has multiple sclerosis, convinced English law lords in
2009 that it was a breach of her human rights not to know whether her husband
would be prosecuted if he accompanied her to the Dignitas clinic.

But the legal position is being challenged again by a 46-year-old man who is
almost paralysed. His lawyers suggest that, if successful, his action could
lead to people seeking the help of doctors to ease their deaths in this
country or enrolling health professionals to help them travel abroad.

Starmer insisted the 2010 framework did not change the law, nor open the door
for euthanasia, but focused on the motivation of the person suspected of
assisting suicide.

Six public interest factors against prosecution include whether the person who
has died had reached a "voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision" and
whether the suspect acted out of compassion and "reported the victim's suicide
to the police and fully assisted them in their inquiries into the
circumstances of the suicide or the attempt and his or her part in providing
encouragement or assistance".

In Scotland there is no offence of assisting suicide but in some circumstances
the law of homicide may apply. Prosecutors have made clear it is up to the
Holyrood parliament to decide whether the law needs changing.
