#  Dream of making artificial body parts becoming a reality

by Lachlan Mackinnon, Daily Mirror  17/01/2012

Human body

It sounds like a sci-fi movie - doctors growing body parts to cure our ills.
But thanks to incredible breakthroughs, bionic repairs for humans are fast
becoming a reality.

Experts yesterday revealed they are perfecting "off the shelf" blood vessels,
which could revolutionise treatment of heart attacks and strokes.

If the Cambridge University blood vessel team is successful, patients could be
spared major operations. The test tube vessels may also treat kidney dialysis
patients and repair injuries.

250;sz=300x250;pos=centre;sect=health-
news;psect=news;zone=news;templ=page;gs_cat=GS_CHANNELS;tile=8;ord=269828595?)

And because the patient's own skin cells are used, there is less chance of
rejection.

Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: "This is very
advanced. Growing blood vessels means they could be used off the shelf and be
put into patients who need bypasses in a leg or heart, which is currently done
using their own veins."

Here are other ways science is giving nature a helping hand...

**1\. EYES**

Experts are working on a cure for blindness - and have taken huge strides
towards their goal.

Miikka Terho, 46, from Finland, who suffered an inherited form of blindness
called retinitis pigmentosa, was fitted with an experimental chip behind his
retina in Germany.

It works by converting light that enters the eye into electrical impulses fed
into the optic nerve, restoring some vision.

**2\. EARS**

Bionic ears are transforming the lives of patients. They send sounds from a
microphone through a metal coil to electrodes inside the inner ear.

A seven-year-old boy, Troy Probert, who was left deaf after seven meningitis
bouts, was able to hear again thanks to computer-activated cochlear implants.

**3\. WINDPIPE**

Patients whose windpipes are ravaged by cancer can have new ones grown in the
lab. Scientists at University College London crafted a fake windpipe filled
with cells taken from a patient's own bone marrow.

Once fitted, the cells divided and grew to make an organ indistinguishable
from a normal one.

**4\. BRAIN**

Brain "pacemakers" are being developed to treat conditions such as Parkinson's
disease.

Patients with the implants, which send electronic impulses deep inside the
brain, reported fewer tremors and stiffness. It involves inserting a wire with
electrodes at its tip, which is connected to a small "neurostimulator" unit.

**5\. FACE**

A liquid that can be injected into the face is being developed to help treat
disfigured people. Surgeons could use it to rebuild areas damaged by disease
or injury.

The liquid, created by Alexander Hillel and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins
University, Maryland, US, can be massaged into shape and set using a special
light beam.

**6\. ARM**

Amputees could be given a new lease of life with bionic limbs. Livingston-
based Touch Bionics' prostethic arm allowed Patrick Kane, 13, who lost his arm
through meningitis, to squash grapes between his fingers.

When he tenses a muscle, tiny pulses of electricity from nerves beneath the
electrodes cause the hand to close - and the same process applies for opening
his fist.

**7\. SPINE**

Paralysed people have been given hope of using their legs again thanks to
research using electrodes.

Baseball star Rob Summers, who was told he would be wheelchair-bound after
being hit by a speeding car in Portland, Oregon, US, made medical history as
the first person paralysed from the chest down to stand and take a step
unaided.

Summers' legs were able to move because of electrical stimulation from a
device implanted in his lower spine.

**8\. SKIN**

Artificial skin used to heal wounds has been developed by UK researchers.

Writing in the journal Regenerative Medicine, UK-based company Intercytex said
it had produced promising results in early trials. The skin is made from
fibrin gel, a blood clotting protein, and fibroblast cells found in human
skin.

**9\. LEGS**

A prosthetic leg that can be programmed for different types of activity and
adjusted by Bluetooth has developed by a UK firm.

The limb, which was designed by Otto Bock Healthcare and fitted by ProActive
Prosthetics in Elstead, contains a micro-processor which can differentiate
between 10 types of activity.

Amputee Matthew Newbury, who is said to be the first person to have the limb
fitted, said: "I don't have to think about every step and therefore I'm not
tiring myself out."

**10\. PANCREAS**

An artificial pancreas has been developed that could be a major advance in the
treatment of diabetes.

The metal pancreas, which holds a supply of the hormone insulin kept in place
by a gel barrier, could lead to daily insulin injections to control blood
sugar levels being unnecessary in the future.

Invented by Professor Joan Taylor at De Montfort University in Leicester, it
could move to clinical trials within the next few years.

**11\. WOMB**

Doctors are developing artificial wombs in which embryos can grow outside a
woman's body.

Embryos successfully attached themselves to the walls of these laboratory
wombs and began to grow. However, experiments had to be terminated after a few
days to comply with in-vitro fertilisation regulations.

**12\. MUSCLES**

Scientists are working on providing replacement muscles for people who
suffered serious sporting injuries or damaged limbs in accidents.

They are using gels that expand and contract in response to small electrical
currents to create synthetic muscles for replacing heart valves.

Scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena are aiming to
develop an arm powered by bionic muscles made from these "electroactive
polymers" that would be capable of winning an arm-wrestling contest.

**13\. BLOOD**

Artificial blood created from stem cells could soon be tested on Britons.

The Edinburgh and Bristol university scientists behind the research, which
could provide industrial-scale quantities of blood, believe it will transform
transfusions by preventing hospital shortages and save thousands of lives on
battlefields and at the scene of car crashes.

If they crack the recipe, just one human embryo could theoretically provide
all the cells ever needed for Britain's blood supply.

14\. LIVER

Scientists have managed to produce a small-scale version of a human liver in
the laboratory using stem cells.

The success increases hope new transplant livers could be manufactured,
although experts say this is still many years away. UK researchers said it was
an "exciting development" but insisted it was not yet certain a fully-
functioning liver was possible.
