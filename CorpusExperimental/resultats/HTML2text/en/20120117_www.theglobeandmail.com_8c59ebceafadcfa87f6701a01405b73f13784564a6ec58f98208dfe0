The B.C. Coroners Service has asked for toxicology tests to be carried out as
soon as possible to determine if ecstasy played a role in the death of a 16
-year-old Langley boy.

The tests, requested from the provincial toxicology lab, will determine
whether the boy took the drug and, if he did, whether the doses he took
contained PMMA (paramethoxy-methamphetamine), a drug recently linked to five
deaths in the province.

"Because of our concern around these [cases], we are trying to prioritize them
and move them to the head of the queue," Barb McClintock, a spokeswoman for
the coroners office, said Monday, adding that it's hoped results would be
available within days.

The Provincial Toxicology Centre will conduct the tests.

The coroners service said Monday it was investigating the death of a boy who
was with others when he reportedly took ecstasy along with other drugs on Jan.
15. When he collapsed, someone nearby called 911 and an ambulance arrived and
rushed the boy to Langley Memorial Hospital, but he could not be revived.

Last week, the Coroners Service announced that PMMA had been linked to five
ecstasy-related deaths in the province in the past six months, with two of
those deaths occurring in January. PMMA has also been linked to several recent
deaths in Alberta.

Police and the coroners office have emphasized the risks of taking ecstasy,
saying there is no known safe dose.

In an interview last week, chief coroner Lisa Lapointe said it isn't clear
whether the PMMA was in one batch or not.

"It could be just the tip of the iceberg. There could be thousands and
thousands of pills out there with PMMA," Ms. Lapointe said Friday in an
interview. "That's the worry. We just don't know. It's an illicit substance."

It's thought that PMMA is being introduced, perhaps accidentally, in the
process of manufacturing ecstasy.

The drug is not routinely tested for, but B.C. reviewed toxicology findings
for 12 ecstasy-related deaths in 2011 and two deaths this year after PMMA was
linked to ecstasy-related deaths in Alberta.

Although PMMA was detected in five cases, the coroners service emphasized that
13 other ecstasy-related deaths in the same period did not involve PMMA.

"The finding of PMMA in five recent cases confirms the danger that has always
been associated with taking ecstasy: There is no guarantee of purity in a drug
that is concocted for profit in a clandestine environment," the office said.

Police have said there are an average 20 deaths from ecstasy each year in
British Columbia.
