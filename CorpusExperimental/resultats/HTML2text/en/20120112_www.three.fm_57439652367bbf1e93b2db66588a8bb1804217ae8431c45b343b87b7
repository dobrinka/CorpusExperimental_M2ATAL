Noble’s Hospital’s new breast surgeon was unveiled today by the Department of
Health.

Ms Millie Bello will take up her post as the Island’s new consultant general
surgeon with a special interest in oncoplastic breast surgery and care.  

  

She will officially begin her role on February 1 when she will head up the
multi-disciplinary breast care service.



Minister for Health, David Anderson said this marked the start of a new era of
breast care in the Isle of Man (see audio).

  

He said: "This appointment marks an exciting development for the Island’s
breast care service. On-Island breast care is now not only secure for the
long-term, with a permanent consultant in post, but can also now be developed
further in line with the Department’s three-phase plan to enhance breast care
services for the people of the Isle of Man.”



Ms Bello and her team will be charged with taking forward the DoH’s plans to
offer a wider range of enhanced services on-Island, providing those who
develop breast cancer with an exceptional standard of care.  

  

These services will include the provision of oncoplastic breast surgery,
sentinel node biopsy, immediate and delayed breast reconstruction,
symmetrisation surgery and aesthetic breast reconstruction.



Ms Bello said: "I am very excited about coming to the Isle of Man.  I’ve
already made a number of visits and the Island offers an excellent quality of
life.  

  

"The community seems very friendly and I’ve already been made to feel welcome.
I’m very much looking forward to working with colleagues to develop the
Island’s breast care service, ensuring that patients receive the highest
standard of care possible.”
