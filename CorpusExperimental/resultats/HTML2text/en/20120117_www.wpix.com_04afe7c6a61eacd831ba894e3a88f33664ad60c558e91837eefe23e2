Alex Rodriquez, of the Bronx, keeps an inhaler for emergencies and last week,
he needed it.  
  
The 28-year-old unemployed, ex-doorman says doctors at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital
cured him of pneumonia. But last week when he received a bill in the mail for
the hospital's services, he felt ill again.  
  
"I almost had an asthma attack," Rodriquez told PIX 11 News. The bill was for
$44,776,587.  
  
"When i saw 44 million, I thought it had to be a mistake," said Rodriquez.  
  
Alex said he is unemployed and doesn't have insurance so he expected a hefty
bill. The hospital estimated he would have to pay $40,000 in installments and
the first bill was only supposed to be for a couple of hundred.  
  
"The union took away my insurance then I got sick," he said.  
  
When he saw the bill, he immediately called the billing firm, PHY services,
and got an automated message that said the invoice was a mistake. And that the
computer accidentally swapped the invoice number with the "amount due."  
  
Rodriquez spoke with a customer representative who said they had received
hundreds of calls. PHY services told him they would send a new bill and an
apology letter.  
  
"People make mistakes, system errors, computer errors. Someone should check
the bill," said Rodriquez.
