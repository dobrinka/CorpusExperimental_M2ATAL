Restaurants to be rated for hygiene

(UKPA) - 1 day ago

Wales could compel restaurants and takeaways to publicly display hygiene
ratings on their premises.

Welsh Government ministers are keen to drive up hygiene standards in the
principality via a proposed "scores-on-the-doors" system.

Under the scheme, businesses will be rated with a score of between zero and
five based on how the food is prepared, cooked, cooled and stored, as well as
the condition of the premises.

All food businesses, including supermarkets, would be required to display
their score in a prominent position or face fines of up to £1,000. Ratings
could also be checked online.

Currently, more than 13,500 businesses have been rated under a voluntary
scheme operated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), although it is estimated
only one in three display their rating.

The new proposals, which would cover around 30,000 businesses in Wales, are
due to be published in a draft bill before being ratified. They come following
a number of E.coli outbreaks in Wales, which led to calls for a tougher
stance.

Health Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "It is already a legal requirement for
food businesses to meet hygiene regulations set out in food law, but
businesses are not currently required to display their ratings and those with
low scores generally do not display them. Compulsory display of hygiene
ratings will encourage all businesses to improve their procedures and drive up
standards."

A Welsh Government statement also said a mandatory scheme has been backed by
Professor Hugh Pennington, who chaired a public inquiry into the 2005 E.coli
outbreak in south Wales. It was second biggest E.coli outbreak in the UK and
resulted in one death, 31 hospital admissions and long-term health
consequences for several children.

Last August, in a separate incident, a kebab house in Cardiff was closed
temporarily when a number of people fell ill in an outbreak of E.coli O157.

A Consumer Focus Wales survey in October showed that 94% of people in Wales
thought it should be compulsory for food businesses to display their food
hygiene rating score.
