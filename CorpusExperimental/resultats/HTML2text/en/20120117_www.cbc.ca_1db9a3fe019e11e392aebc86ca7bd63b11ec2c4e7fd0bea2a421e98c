Dozens of people ill in a suspected outbreak of norovirus at a student
journalism conference in Victoria are under voluntary quarantine in their
hotel rooms.

About 60 of the 360 people attending the Canadian University Press's annual
NASH conference for student journalists are in voluntary isolation Sunday at
the Harbour Towers Hotel and Suites in downtown Victoria, delegate Emma
Godmere told CBC News.

Godmere, who also fell ill, said paramedics attended the hotel early Sunday
morning. Several others went to hospital overnight with what's believed to be
norovirus.

Laura Brown of The Aquinian, a student newspaper at Fredericton's St. Thomas
University, said that five out of 10 of the paper's staff at the conference
have symptoms of norovirus, which include vomiting, diarrhea, cramping,
headaches and muscle aches.

"B.C. Public Health ... suggested that based on the evidence that we were
sharing with them and the fast spread of what this was, that we're looking at
norovirus. It hasn't exactly been confirmed by anyone yet but that's the
assumption that we're working with now," said Godmere, CUP's national bureau
chief from Toronto.

Delegates had a buffet dinner at the hotel and then boarded buses for an event
at the University of Victoria. People started getting sick on the buses, said
Jonny Wakefield, a University of British Columbia student. He said three
people from his student newspaper fell ill.

"First it was just the one guy who threw up on the back of my head, so for a
while I was angry at him. Then I found out everyone else was throwing up as
well," said delegate Brennan Bova. The post-dinner event was cancelled.

Most out-of-town delegates were to return home on Sunday, but those who are
sick have been asked not to leave the hotel. It's caused some rebooking
headaches for the students.

"According to the messages that the conference co-ordinator has been sending
us, it's not an official quarantine under B.C. Health, so WestJet can't give
us any accommodation," said Brown.

The 74th NASH conference began Wednesday and ended Sunday in Victoria. It was
hosted by the Martlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria,
and the Nexus, the paper for students at Camosun College.
