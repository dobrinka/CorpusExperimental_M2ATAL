_A recent study from the Dental Organization for Conscious Sedation (DOCS)
shows that 30% of Americans avoid the dentist because of fear or anxiety. Dr.
Jerry Strauss, a dentist in New Jersey, says he not only uses sedation
dentistry to alleviate patient fears, but also create positive dental
experiences. He adds that patients need to discuss all available options with
their dentist, and develop a plan that meets their needs and expectations when
considering sedation dentistry._

Fairfield, NJ (PRWEB) January 17, 2012

The Dental Organization for Conscious Sedation (DOCS) recently conducted a
study that found 30% of Americans avoid dental visits because of fear or
anxiety. Dr. Jerry Strauss provides a wide range of dental treatments,
including general, sedation, and cosmetic dentistry in New Jersey. He says
sedation dentistry allows his patients to relax, which in turn helps create
positive dental experiences and safe, effective results. When choosing a
sedation dentistry practice, Dr. Strauss recommends discussing all available
options for sedation, as well as the dentist's experience with each procedure.

Also commonly referred to as sleep dentistry, Dr. Strauss says the name can be
misleading as the patient actually remains conscious throughout the entire
procedure. The purpose of sedation dentistry according to Dr. Strauss is
simply to put the patient in a state of relaxation to ensure they are not
consumed by the fear they typically experience during dental treatment.

While intravenous sedation is the traditional method used for sedation
dentistry, Dr. Strauss says less invasive methods are gaining in popularity,
including inhalation sedation and oral sedation. Regardless of the method
employed, Dr. Strauss says the dental procedure does not necessarily determine
the type of sedation method. Instead, he stresses the need to address each
individual treatment plan along with the specifics of a patient's case before
deciding on the type of sedation.

Ultimately, Dr. Strauss says patients appreciate the sedation dentistry option
at his practice because they do not have to feel the pain or experience
anxiety associated with any number of the procedures he offers. However, Dr.
Strauss says the main benefit of alleviating these concerns for his patients
is the fact that it allows him and his staff to maintain the oral health of
his patients. "Fortunately, sedation techniques allow us to comfortably treat
the true dental phobics, those people that have had bad experiences and have
anxiety about dental treatment and even the medically compromised. I believe
dental sedation is one of the real critical components to success in
dentistry."

About Jerry Strauss, DMD

Dr. Jerry Strauss earned his dental degree from the Boston University School
of Dentistry. Upon graduation, he received the Academy of General Dentistry
Award from the faculty at Boston University. Dr. Strauss is also a graduate of
the Las Vegas Institute for Advanced Dental Studies. He has achieved
Mastership Status in the Academy of General Dentistry, which is the highest
honor the organization bestows upon its members. Dr. Strauss is a member of
the American Dental Association, the NewJersey Dental Society, and the
American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry.
