After more than 100 years of service to the hospital, officials at
Misericordia Health Centre have pulled the plug on the Maryland South
building.

The building, the first phase of which was built in 1906, met with a
5,000-pound wrecking ball Wednesday morning, and the meeting was decidedly
one-sided.

Bricks, concrete and other materials rained down as the ball smashed the
building's roof, eliciting squeals of delight from the students at Mulvey
School, who watched from the schoolyard as the building across the street took
blow after blow.

The old girl did put up a bit of a fight, at one point fraying the supportive
cable enough to disconnect the wrecking ball from the crane -- something
project superintendent George Vincent said isn't uncommon in largescale demos.

It's expected to take 35 days for the Maryland South building to be completely
demolished and the rubble cleaned up.

Over the years, the building has been home to interim care and acute care
units, a cafeteria and a chapel, but hospital brass have been planning its
replacement for more than two decades. The project is finally being realized
as part of a multi-million dollar redevelopment project that will see a new
two-storey health complex rise in the Maryland South building's place. The new
complex, to be built over the next 18 to 24 months, will house the Buhler Eye
Care Centre, an ambulatory diagnostic centre, and a health centre for seniors
touted as a "one-stop shop" for everything from rehabilitation to social
activities.

Phase 2 of the redevelopment plan will see the Sherbrook Building on the other
side of the hospital demolished and replaced with a new chapel and front
entrance, as well as space for medical programs.

A frayed cable caused the wrecking ball to disconnect and fall into the
building's interior during a demolition at Misericordia Health Centre in
Winnipeg on Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2012. The project's supervisor said that's not
an unusual occurrence since the ball is being dragged in and out of jagged
holes. (PAUL TURENNE/Winnipeg Sun)
