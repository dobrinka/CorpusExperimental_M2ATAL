Deen, the Southern-style cook whose drawl is as rich as some of her dishes,
has Type 2 diabetes. She made the announcement yesterday in a release for her
new Diabetes in a New Light website and products.

This morning on _Today_, the Food Network star admitted to Al Roker she
learned of her diagnosis during a routine check-up three years ago but decided
not to take that news public until she could "bring something to the table
when I came forward."

Deen, whose menu has been criticized by other celebrity chefs for being
unhealthy, insisted to Roker that she always encouraged moderation when it
comes to diet, including her own.

Watch the clip below:

Is the sad news that Deen has diabetes complicated in your mind by the fact
that she's now a paid spokesperson for a pharmaceutical company? Did she have
any responsibility to share the news of her illness with her loyal foodies
sooner?
