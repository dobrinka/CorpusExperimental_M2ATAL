###  La Nina linked to killer flu pandemics

The La Niña weather pattern could be triggering flu pandemics such as 2009's
swine flu, scientists suggest.

1957, 1968 and 2009 - all years preceded by La Niña conditions in the
equatorial Pacific.

The reason, say Jeffrey Shaman of Columbia University and Marc Lipsitch of the
Harvard School of Public Health that the La Niña pattern is known to alter the
migratory patterns of birds - believed to be a primary reservoir of human
influenza.

They suggest that alterations in migration patterns promote the development of
dangerous new strains of influenza.

"We know that pandemics arise from dramatic changes in the influenza genome,"
says Shaman.

"Our hypothesis is that La Niña sets the stage for these changes by
reshuffling the mixing patterns of migratory birds, which are a major
reservoir for influenza."

The researchers studied ocean temperatures records for the equatorial Pacific
covering the fall and winter before the four most recent flu pandemics
emerged.

They found that all four were preceded by the below-normal sea surface
temperatures that are associated with the La Niña phase of the El Niño-
Southern Oscillation.

Research shows that the La Niña pattern alters the migration, stopover time,
fitness and interspecies mixing of migratory birds. These conditions could
favor the kind of gene swapping that creates new variations of the influenza
virus, say the scientists.

More worryingly, changes in migration don't just alter the pattern of contact
among bird species. They can also change the ways that birds come into contact
with domestic animals such as pigs - and it was gene-swapping between avian
and pig flu viruses that's believed to have triggered the 2009 swine flu
pandemic.
