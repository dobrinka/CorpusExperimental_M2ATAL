DNA testing for the human papilloma virus in cervical cancer screening is the
best option for detecting the cancer in women over 30, finds a new study.

The report finds suggests that HPV detection through DNA screening is more
sensitive than standard Pap tests in detecting precancerous high-grade lesions
on the cervix. High-risk HPV was present in nearly all cervical cancers, the
authors say. In the study, women were randomly assigned to receive either HPV
DNA testing and cytology or cytology alone. A second screening was conducted
five years later and HPV and cytology tests were conducted at that point.

The first screen found significantly more precancerous lesions (dysplasia) of
Grade 2 or worse than cytology screens alone. Five years later, the second
screen found significantly fewer women had cervical cancer lesions of Grade 3
or worse. The most advanced form of dysplasia, CIN 3, is actually the very
earliest form of cancer, according to the Canadian Cancer Society. The authors
belive that because more lesions were found at earlier stages in the first
round of screening, there were significantly fewer advanced cases of cervical
cancer five years later.

â€œImplementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier
detection of clinically relevant CIN Grade 2 or worse, which when adequately
treated, improves protection against CIN Grade 3 or worse and cervical
cancer," reads the study.

Whether HPV testing is a better diagnostic tool in a longer screening period
has not been established, say the authors.

The report, Human papilloma virus testing for the detection of high-grade
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer, was conducted by researchers at
the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam and involved 45,000 women aged
29 to 56 between January 1999 and September 2002.

It is published in the Wednesday online edition of the Lancet.
