  * # **The EU ''is putting NHS patients at risk''**

_12 January 2012_

The working time directive from the European Union (EU) and the poor English
language skills that doctors from the EU have are putting the health of
patients at risk, according to the heads of two royal colleges.  
  
The president of the Royal College of Surgeons Professor Norman Williams and
Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, wrote in a
letter to the Daily Telegraph: "The language competency of doctors from the EU
working in Britain, and the stifling effect of the European working time
directive on the time that trainee doctors have to learn on the job, need
urgent action."  
  
They went on: "EU laws that apply to all sectors can have unintended
consequences in healthcare that can put patients at risk, whether in Britain
or other member states. The increased mobility of health professionals in the
EU has highlighted huge variations both in the practical abilities of
professionals of similar grades, and in the systems set up to ensure quality,
in different member states."  
  
In response, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: "We agree that for too
long patients have been let down by European rules which allowed doctors to
operate in the UK without the necessary safeguards. That's why I announced
last year new rules on checking doctors' language skills and new powers to
take action against doctors who can't speak English properly."  
  
He added: "We want to revise the [European working time directive] to give the
NHS the flexibility it needs on training. Our overriding concern must be to
protect patients."
