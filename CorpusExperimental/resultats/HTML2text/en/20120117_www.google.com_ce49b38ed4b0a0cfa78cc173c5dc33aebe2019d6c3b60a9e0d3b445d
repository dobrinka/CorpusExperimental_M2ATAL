Tidal energy turbine gets all-clear

(UKPA) - 2 hours ago

A tidal energy turbine in Co Down has been given the environmental all-clear,
the developers have said.

SeaGen in Strangford Lough has had no major impact on the marine life with no
changes in the population of seals or porpoises.

There have been "small scale" shifts in the behaviour and distribution of the
creatures to avoid the turbines, the owners Marine Current Turbines Ltd said.
The seabed surrounding the machine's foundations has recovered since it was
installed in 2008.

SeaGen can generate enough power for 1,500 homes.

Environment Minister Alex Attwood said: "Marine Current Turbines has proved
that the power of the seas can be harnessed in harmony with marine life.

"The results of their work will give everyone greater confidence in realising
the economic and environmental benefits that tidal and wave energy can offer
to Northern Ireland, elsewhere in the UK and Ireland as well as other parts of
the world."

SeaGen works like an underwater windmill, with the rotors driven by tidal
currents rather than the wind. Its operation has been limited to daylight
hours but these restrictions have been lifted.

The Royal Haskoning report was produced by an environmental consultancy with
an independent science group.

No major impact has been detected on the environment and there have been no
changes in the abundance of seals or porpoises attributed to SeaGen, they are
continuing to swim past the machine without hindrance.

The owners said: "The only changes observed after three years of operation of
SeaGen have been relatively small scale changes in the behaviour and
distribution of seals and harbour porpoises, which suggests a minor degree of
local avoidance of SeaGen."
