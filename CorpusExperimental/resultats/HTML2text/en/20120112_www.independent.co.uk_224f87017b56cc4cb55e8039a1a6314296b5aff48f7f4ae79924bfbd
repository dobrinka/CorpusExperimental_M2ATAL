The blame game in the breast implant scandal intensified yesterday as one of
Britain's largest private surgery clinics defied the Government by declaring
it would not replace the defective implants free of charge.

The announcement by the Harley Medical Group came as Andrew Lansley launched
three separate inquiries into the debacle which has left at least 40,000 women
in the UK at risk from the industrial grade silicone contained in the Poly
Implant Prothese implants.

In the Commons, Mr Lansley reiterated the Government's view that private
clinics had a moral duty to look after their patients.

But Mel Graham, chairman of the Harley Medical Group, said the Government had
a moral responsibility to replace the PIP implants, because of a regulatory
failure.

"We're only sitting here today because the Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency [MHRA], their own regulatory authority, has approved these
implants and obviously hasn't done [the] proper checking. We're an innocent
victim like everyone else, we're attempting to do our best for our patients."

Mr Lansley blamed PIP, the French manufacturer of the implants, which fooled
regulators by hiding the cheap industrial silicone when inspectors came to
visit.

But he announced further investigations into the the EU approval of the
devices which resulted in them receiving a CE mark, the actions of the MHRA
and reviews by NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh and the Care Quality
Commission of the regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry.

Sources said Mr Lansley was dismayed at the response of the private clinics –
Transform, a second private chain, has also refused to replace the implants at
its own cost – and warned NHS waiting lists could rise as a result. Worried
women who cannot get help from their private clinic have been told they can
have the implants removed on the NHS.

A source said: "The private clinics have a duty of care to their patients,
they have made a lot of money and to leave women on their own is not good
enough."
