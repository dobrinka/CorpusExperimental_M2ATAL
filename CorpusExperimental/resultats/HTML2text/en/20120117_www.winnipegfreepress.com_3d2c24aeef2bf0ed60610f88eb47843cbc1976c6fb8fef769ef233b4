An average of 230 Manitobans try to quit smoking every day. This week, their
odds of quitting are better than ever.

It's National Non-Smoking Week and the Canadian Cancer Society has rolled out
a new initiative called Break It Off to help young smokers kick the habit
before they cause further damage to themselves.

"The big thing is the website, BreakItOff.ca," said CCS tobacco advocacy co-
ordinator Will Cooke. "This was done in conjunction with Health Canada and is
aimed at a younger demographic."

"Right now the highest smoking rate in Manitoba is among young people. We
wanted to create a tool that is relevant to that age group."

Break It Off aims to get smokers to view their relationship with cigarettes as
extremely unhealthy and encourages them to "break up" with their addiction.

"There are a lot of cool features young adults can use on the site," Cooke
said. "You can even end your relationship with smoking publicly with a status
update on Facebook."

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, a "public breakup" with smoking can
greatly increase the chances of success.

"People successfully quit smoking in many ways and we have all sorts of tools
to help them improve their chance of success," said Cooke in a media release.
"It's all about helping people quit and improving their odds of staying
tobacco-free."

The CCS also offers their Smokers' Helpline to help all Manitobans cope with
the difficulties in quitting smoking.

"Medication like Champix can help, but another thing that helps people quit is
getting telephone counselling," said Cooke.

Manitoba continues to have one of the highest smoking rates in Canada with
about one in five Manitobans lighting up.

Benefits of butting out worth the effort

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, smokers feel pretty lousy after
their initial 'breakup' with cigarettes. But here are the benefits you can
expect after:

Eight hours: Increased oxygen in your system and lower blood pressure may have
you feeling like a heavy weight is being lifted.

One day: Your lungs should be working better, leaving you out of breath a lot
less often.

Two days: Your sense of taste and smell should be making a pleasant return.

One week: Increased blood flow to your hands and feet should have you feeling
a lot less cold.

Four weeks: As your lung function continues to improve, physical activity
should be quite a bit easier.

Six weeks: You should notice less coughing, sinus congestion and shortness of
breath.

One year: Your risk of coronary heart disease is about half that of an average
smoker.

Three years: Your risk of heart attack is similar to someone who has never
smoked.

Five years: You have reduced your risk of getting cancer of the lung, mouth,
throat, bladder, kidney and pancreas.
