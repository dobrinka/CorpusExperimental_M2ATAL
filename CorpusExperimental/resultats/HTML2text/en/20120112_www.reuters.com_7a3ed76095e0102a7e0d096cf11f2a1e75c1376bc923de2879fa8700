NEW YORK | Wed Jan 11, 2012 6:50pm EST

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A University of Connecticut researcher who studied
the link between aging and a substance found in red wine has committed more
than 100 acts of data fabrication and falsification, the university said on
Wednesday, throwing much of his work into doubt.

Dipak K. Das, who directed the university's Cardiovascular Research Center,
studied resveratrol, touted by a number of scientists and companies as a way
to slow aging or remain healthy as people get older. Among his findings,
according to a work promoted by the University of Connecticut in 2007, was
that "the pulp of grapes is as heart-healthy as the skin, even though the
antioxidant properties differ."

"We have a responsibility to correct the scientific record and inform peer
researchers across the country," Philip Austin, the university's interim vice
president for health affairs, said in a statement.

The university said an anonymous tip led to an investigation that began in
2008. A 60,000-page report -- the summary of which is available at
bit.ly/xkyS4A \-- resulted, outlining 145 counts of fabrication and
falsification of data. Other members of Das' laboratory may have been
involved, and are being investigated, the report said.

The university has "declined to accept $890,000 in federal grants awarded to"
Das, according to the statement, and has begun dismissal proceedings. The
university has alerted 11 journals that published Das' work.

The university said it has been working on the matter with the Office of
Research Integrity, a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health that
investigates alleged misconduct by federal grant recipients.

The journals include Antioxidants & Redox Signaling, where Das was one of the
editors in chief, and the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry.

Although many scientists have been skeptical of various claims made about
resveratrol, it has garnered significant commercial interest. British
drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline bought Sirtris, a company that worked on the
compound, in 2008 for $720 million but later discontinued work on one version
of a drug that mimics its activity because of disappointing results.

A Las Vegas resveratrol maker called Longevinex has promoted Das' research,
and he appears in a lengthy video touting the nutrient as the next aspirin.

Das also shared a 2002 patent on the use of another compound in grape skins
called proanthocyanidin to prevent and treat heart conditions.

Other scientists have taken notice of Das' work, citing 30 of his papers more
than 100 times each, according to Thomson Scientific's Web of Knowledge. Last
year, he won an award from the International Association of Cardiologists.

Still, one aging researcher said the impact of the fraud on the field will be
minimal.

"There are many investigators who are working on resveratrol," said Dr. Nir
Barzilai, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. "That doesn't mean we know
the whole truth. But Rome wasn't built on Dr. Das."

Das, who could not be reached for comment, said in a 2010 letter to university
officials that the investigation was a "conspiracy" against him. The work was
"repeated by many scientists all over the world," he wrote.

"As you know, because of the development of a tremendous amount of stress in
my work environment in recent months, I became a victim of stroke for which I
am undergoing treatment," he wrote in a separate letter.
