# Alcohol risk to fetus is highest at end of 1st trimester

Any drinking during pregnancy increases the odds of fetal alcohol syndrome,
but the risk to the fetus is highest if a pregnant woman drinks during the
second half of her first trimester of pregnancy, a new study finds.

For every one drink per day increase in alcohol intake during that crucial
period, a woman’s baby was 25 percent more likely to have an abnormally shaped
lip, 12 percent more likely to have a smaller-than-normal head and 16 percent
more likely to have low birth weight — all early signs of fetal alcohol
syndrome, the study showed.

"The take-home message is that there's not a low threshold level below which
drinking alcohol doesn't raise the risk," of fetal alcohol syndrome, said
study author Dr. Christina Chambers of the University of California, San
Diego. "This supports the surgeon general's recommendation that drinking be
avoided entirely."

The new findings were published today (Jan. 16) in the journal Alcoholism:
Clinical and Experimental Research.

**Pregnancy and substances**

Chambers and her colleagues recruited the 992 participants for their study
from pregnant women who called a California telephone help line that answers
questions on substances that could be harmful during pregnancy — including not
only alcohol and illegal drug intake, but also chemical exposures and
prescription drug safety.

Women who called the line between 1978 and 2005 were asked if they'd like to
participate in a follow-up study. All were contacted by phone for follow-up on
levels of alcohol consumption throughout pregnancy, and their infants were
screened after birth with a full physical exam.

"You're dealing with an issue here in which it's really hard to get good
information on both exposure and outcomes," Chambers said. "Most kids don't
get diagnosed until they're in school and having learning difficulties,"
Chambers said.

In the study, the doctors who examined the infants did not know whether the
child had been exposed to alcohol or some other substance in utero.

Higher alcohol consumption of a mother during pregnancy, the researchers
found, was linked with a higher chance of a baby having physical
characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, including abnormal
head size and altered shape of the eyes and lips. Such symptoms suggest the
presence of related neurological problems.

Binge drinking, which involves drinking more than four drinks on a single
occasion, didn't affect the risk — the total number of drinks a woman had
while pregnant was more predictive of a baby's risk of fetal alcohol syndrome,
the researchers found.

During the second half of the first trimester, every one drink per day
increase in alcohol intake raised the odds of a certain physical abnormality —
in the upper lip — by 25 percent. In contrast, the average number of drinks
during the third trimester seemed to affect only the baby's length at birth.

**Different mothers, different risk**

There are still questions about what factors may influence the risk of fetal
alcohol syndrome, Chambers said. "Even if you find 10 women who drink a quart
of vodka a day, maybe only five of those babies will have full-blown fetal
alcohol syndrome, because there are other factors that influence the risk."

Those factors could include diet, body fat levels, genetic differences, or
other environmental exposures, said Ed Riley of San Diego State University,
who also studies prenatal exposure to alcohol.

Other studies have found little or no affect on babies born to mothers who
drank only occasionally — having one or two drinks a week — throughout
pregnancy. But most previous studies relied on mothers' recall of their
drinking after birth, whereas in the new study, researchers interviewed women
periodically throughout pregnancy.

Riley said the new study adds weight to the argument against drinking any
alcohol during pregnancy, and emphasized that the new study showed that any
alcohol consumption led to an increased risk. "They showed no threshold
effect," he said, "so the more you drank, the greater probability of having an
adverse outcome."

Future studies, he said, could follow the same method to look at not only
physical abnormalities of the infants, but neurological problems as well. "We
know that the brain is very sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure," he said.

**Pass it on:**** ** Any amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy raises the chances that the fetus will develop birth defects, new research concludes. The risk is highest when pregnant women drink during the second half of the first trimester.
