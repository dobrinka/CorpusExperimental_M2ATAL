Following ongoing shellfish toxin monitoring the Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning
(PSP) toxin warning has been extended eastwards to include Whakatane Heads.

The affected area now includes the entire coastline from Tairua (including
Tairua Harbour), east along the Bay of Plenty coastline, including Tauranga
Harbour, Maketu and Waihi estuaries, to Whakatane Heads. Also included in the
warning are Matakana and Motiti islands, and all other inshore islands along
this coastline.

The health warning applies to all bi-valve shellfish including mussels, pipi,
tuatua, cockles, oysters, scallops as well as catseyes and kina (sea urchin).
Shellfish in the affected area should not be taken or consumed. Paua, crayfish
and crabs can still be taken but as always, the gut should be removed before
cooking.

Consumption of shellfish affected by the paralytic shellfish toxin can cause
numbness and tingling around the mouth, face or extremities; difficulty
swallowing or breathing; dizziness; double vision; and in severe cases,
paralysis and respiratory failure. These symptoms usually occur within 12
hours of a person consuming affected shellfish. Anyone suffering illness after
eating shellfish should seek medical attention.

Monitoring of toxin levels will continue along the coast and any changes will
be communicated accordingly.

For all health warning updates across the Bay of Plenty and Lakes districts
call 0800 221 555.
