An extensive misconduct investigation that took three years to complete and
produced a 60,000-page report, concludes that a researcher who has come to
prominence in recent years for his investigations into the beneficial
properties of resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, "is guilty of 145
counts of fabrication and falsification of data".  
  
In a statement published on the university's news website on Wednesday, the
University of Connecticut (UConn) Health Center said the investigation has led
them to inform 11 scientific journals that had published studies conducted by
Dr Dipak K. Das, a professor in the unversity's Department of Surgery and
director of its Cardiovascular Research Center.  
  
The internal investigation, which covered seven years of work in Das's lab,
was triggered by an anonyomous allegation of "research irregularities" in
2008.  
  
Das has been in UConn's employ since 1984, and was awarded tenure in 1993.  
  
UConn Health Center said it worked closely with the US Office of Research
Integrity (ORI) throughout its internal investigation. ORI have received the
report, and they will now conduct an independent investigation.  
  
Inquiries involving former members of the lab are still under way, and no
findings have been released as yet.  
  
All externally funded research in Das's lab is now frozen, and the Health
Center has declined nearly $900,000 in federal grants awarded to Das.  
  
Philip Austin, UConn's interim vice president for health affairs, said:  
  
"We have a responsibility to correct the scientific record and inform peer
researchers across the country."  
  
He expressed gratitude to the individual who "chose to do the right thing" and
alert the university authorities about the irregularities.  
  
UConn has initiated dismissal proceedings, in accordance with the unversity's
bylaws.  
  
Austin said while the university authorities are "deeply disappointed by the
flagrant disregard" for the university's code of conduct, they are "pleased
the oversight systems in place were effective and worked as intended".  
  
He said the abuses in Das's lab are not representative of the overall quality
of UConn Health Center's biomedical research, which "continues to pursue
advances in treatments and cures with the utmost integrity".  
  
The 11 journals that UConn has informed are: American Journal of Physiology -
Heart & Circulatory; Antioxidants & Redox Signaling; Cellular Physiology &
Biochemistry; Free Radical Biology; Free Radical Research; Journal of
Agriculture and Food Chemistry; Journal of Cellular & Molecular Medicine;
Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry; Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental
Therapeutics; Molecular & Cellular Cardiology; Molecular & Cellular Chemistry.  
  
There is a suggestion that the impact of this news on resveratrol research
will be minimal.  
  
According to a report from the Associated Press (AP), Dr Nir Barzilai, whose
team conducts resveratrol research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in New York, says Das is not a major player in the field.  
  
Barzilai told AP lots of labs around the world are conducting extensive
research into resveratrol, with encouraging results, and the new allegation
will not make a material difference.
