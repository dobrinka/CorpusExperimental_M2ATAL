PATIENTS at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital have been struck with the winter
vomiting disease, Norovirus.

Five wards at the hospital are closed so far, and they are all elderly medical
wards.

Visitors are banned from wards except for where the patient is critically ill,
for example in the Intensive Care Unit.

An L&amp;D spokesperson said: “The L&amp;D has several cases of winter
vomiting disease (norovirus). In order to protect our patients, and members of
the public, we are closing hospital wards to all visitors (with some
exceptions).

“Additionally we are asking the public only to come to A&amp;E if it is a real
emergency, and if people do need to come to A&amp;E please don’t bring the
whole family - just one person to accompany the patient.

“These measures are necessary to protect our patients and public from the
highly contagious norovirus which causes projectile vomiting and
uncontrollable diarrhoea.”

The ban on visitors is expected to last for 24-48 hours.

The spokesperson said if members of the public think they may have winter
vomiting disease, they should not go to A&amp;E as there is no treatment for
this virus, it needs to run its course over two or three days.

The best advice is stay indoors, isolate yourself from other people and drink
lots of water to keep rehydrated.

For further advice call NHS Direct 0845 4647.
