disagreed about over whether taste buds could detect fat. New research finds
the tongue recognizes fat and that variations in a gene make people more or
less sensitive to the taste of fat in foods. Credit: Washington University

**Why do we like fatty foods so much? We can blame our taste buds.**

Our tongues apparently recognize and have an affinity for fat, according to
researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. They
have found that variations in a gene can make people more or less sensitive to
the taste of fat.

The study is the first to identify a human receptor that can taste fat and
suggests that some people may be more sensitive to the presence of fat in
foods. The study is available online in the _Journal of Lipid Research_.

Investigators found that people with a particular variant of the CD36 gene are
far more sensitive to the presence of fat than others.

"The ultimate goal is to understand how our perception of fat in food might
influence what foods we eat and the quantities of fat that we consume," says
senior investigator Nada A. Abumrad, PhD, the Dr. Robert A. Atkins Professor
of Medicine and Obesity Research. "In this study, we've found one potential
reason for individual variability in how people sense fat. It may be, as was
shown recently, that as people consume more fat, they become less sensitive to
it, requiring more intake for the same satisfaction. What we will need to
determine in the future is whether our ability to detect fat in foods
influences our fat intake, which clearly would have an impact on obesity."

People who made more CD36 protein could easily detect the presence of fat. In
fact, study subjects who made the most CD36 were eight times more sensitive to
the presence of fat than those who made about 50 percent less of the protein.

The researchers studied 21 people with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more,
which is considered to be obese. Some participants had a genetic variant that
led to the production of more CD36. Others made much less. And some were in
between.

Participants were asked to taste solutions from three different cups. One
contained small amounts of a fatty oil. The other two contained solutions that
were similar in texture to the oil but were fat-free. Subjects were asked to
choose the cup that was different.

Washington University researchers are the first to identify a potential human
receptor for tasting fat. In a series of taste tests, they've found that
people can identify fat in a liquid solution and that their ability to
identify fat changes according to how much of a particular receptor protein
they manufacture. Jim Dryden reports. Credit: Washington University BioMed

"We did the same three-cup test several times with each subject to learn the
thresholds at which individuals could identify fat in the solution," explains
first author M. Yanina Pepino, PhD, research assistant professor of medicine.
"If we had asked, 'does it taste like fat to you?' that could be very
subjective. So we tried to objectively measure the lowest concentration of fat
at which someone could detect a difference."

Her team masked input that might help participants identify fat by sight or
smell. To eliminate visual cues, they lit the testing area with a red lamp.
Study subjects also wore nose clips so that they could not smell the
solutions.

Fat is an important component of the diet, and both humans and animals usually
prefer high-fat, energy-dense foods. Scientists have believed that people
identify those high-fat foods mainly by texture, but this study suggests that
the presence of fat can change the way our tongues perceive the food, just as
it does for the tastes sweet, sour, bitter, salty and savory (umami).

The CD36 discovery follows research that had identified a role for the gene in
rats and mice. Scientists had learned that when animals are genetically
engineered without a working CD36 gene, they no longer display a preference
for fatty foods. In addition, animals that can't make the CD36 protein have
difficulty digesting fat.

Up to 20 percent of people are believed to have the variant in the CD36 gene
that is associated with making significantly less CD36 protein. That, in turn,
could mean they are less sensitive to the presence of fat in food.

Abumrad was the first to identify CD36 as the protein that facilitates the
uptake of fatty acids. She says better understanding of how the protein works
in people could be important in the fight against obesity.

People with obesity are at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease,
stroke, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, arthritis and other problems.
Obesity rates have risen dramatically over the past 30 years as more people
have become sedentary, and diets incorporate more hamburgers, French fries,
fried chicken and other high-fat foods.

"Diet can affect sensitivity to fat, and in animals, diet also influences the
amount of CD36 that's made," Pepino says. "If we follow the results in
animals, a high-fat diet would lead to less production of CD36, and that, in
turn, could make a person less sensitive to fat. From our results in this
study, we would hypothesize that people with obesity may make less of the CD36
protein. So it would seem logical that the amounts of the protein we make can
be modified, both by a person's genetics and by the diet they eat."

Our diet contains fat, mainly in the form of triglycerides, which are made of
fatty acids linked to glyerol. In the tast test, the researchers presented
subjects with two types of fat. Some cups contained a free fatty acid. Others
contained triglyerides.

Pepino and Abumrad knew from animal studies that CD36 is activated by fatty
acids but not triglycerides. Human subjects, however, were able to taste both.
Pepino believes that's probably due to the activity of an enzyme called lipase
in the saliva that breaks the triglycerides, releasing the fatty acids while
the fat is still in the mouth.

"Rats, for example, can produce salivary lipase, and the lipase quickly will
begin to digest the triglyceride and convert it into a fatty acid," she
explains. "In humans, the role of lipase hasn't been as clear. In our
experiments, people could detect fat whether it was a triglyceride or a fatty
acid."

But when the researchers added the diet drug orlistat, subjects could still
taste the fatty acids but were less able to detect the triglycerides. Orlistat
inhibits lipase in the mouth, stomach and intestine and is often prescribed to
people who are obese to prevent them from absorbing fat in foods.

"Orlistat made it more difficult for people to taste fat," Pepino says. "The
solution had to contain higher amounts of triglyceride before they could
detect fat. With free fatty acid, however, there was no difference."
