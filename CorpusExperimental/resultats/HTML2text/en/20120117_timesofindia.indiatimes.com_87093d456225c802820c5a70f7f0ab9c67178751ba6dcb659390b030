LONDON: It's long known that there are five basic tastes which the human
tongue can detect - sweet, sour, salty, bitter and savoury. Now, scientists
say there exists a sixth one - fat.

A team at Washington University in US claims to have identified a potential
chemical receptor for tasting fat, and also found that its sensitivity varies
between individuals, the Journal of Lipid Research reported. The receptor is,
in fact, located in the taste buds on the tongue which recognizes fat
molecules, say the scientists.

The finding may help to explain why some people consume more fatty foods, as
they are less aware of the taste as they eat, and can be used to combat
obesity by increasing people's sensitivity to fat in their food, the team
says.

In their research, the scientists have showed that people with more of a
receptor called CD36 were better at detecting the presence of fat in food.
They found that variations in a gene that produces CD36 makes people more or
less sensitive to the presence of fat.

The study found that those with half as much CD36 were eight times less
sensitive to the presence of fat. "The ultimate goal is to understand how our
perception of fat in food might influence what foods we eat and the qualities
of fat that we consume . We've found one potential reason for individual
variability in how people sense fat.

"What we will need to determine in the future is whether our ability to detect
fat in foods influences our fat intake, which clearly would have an impact on
obesity," the Sunday Telegraph quoted Nada Abumrad, who led the team.

Up to 20% of people are believed to have a variant of the CD36 gene that is
associated with producing lower levels of the receptor, which could mean they
are less sensitive to the presence of fat in food. This may make them more
prone to obesity.

Yanina Pepino, a team member, added, "If we follow the results in animals, a
high-fat diet would lead to less production of CD36, and that, in turn, could
make a person less sensitive to fat.
