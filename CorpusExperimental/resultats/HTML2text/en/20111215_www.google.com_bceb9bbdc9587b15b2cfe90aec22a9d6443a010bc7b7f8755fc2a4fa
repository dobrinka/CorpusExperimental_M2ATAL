Level of poor health 'unacceptable'

(UKPA) - 1 day ago

Obesity and excessive drinking are continuing to cause unacceptable levels of
ill health, Scotland's top doctor has said.

Chief Medical Officer Sir Harry Burns said action to improve the nation's
health is proving effective in some areas such as smoking-related illnesses
but that challenges remain in tackling poor diet and alcohol consumption.

He used his annual report to highlight that death rates from Scotland's big
three killers, cancer, coronary heart disease and stroke, continue to decline.
Sir Harry also welcomed a fall in smoking-related illnesses, coupled with a
narrowing gap in their occurrence between rich and poor.

He said: "This outcome has been achieved by a combination of legislation and
action across communities to highlight the dangers of smoking and to support
smokers in their attempts to quit.

"In other areas, improvements have yet to be realised. Obesity, poor diet and
excessive alcohol consumption continue to be a cause of unacceptable levels of
ill health, which are inequitably distributed across society."

The report also highlighted a 28% decline in the premature mortality rate, the
rate of death from all causes in people under 75. The proportion fell from 507
per 100,000 people in 1995 to 365 per 100,000 in 2009.

Premature deaths as a result of cancer fell by 22% over the same period, heart
disease deaths were down 60% and deaths from stroke were down 54%. Several
factors were attributed to the reductions, such as early detection, better
treatment and better organisation of care.

Sir Harry also highlighted the benefits of helping people to help themselves,
which suggests people are healthier when they are given the skills and
knowledge to take control of their own lives.

He said: "If we are to make a significant impact on the incidence of ill
health in Scotland, we need to pay attention to the ways in which we create
health."

Sir Harry added: "There is willingness in Scotland to embrace new thinking in
our efforts to narrow health inequalities, and make Scotland a better place to
grow and develop. If we can capitalise on this positive mindset, we can make
changes which may result in significant improvements to the health and well-
being of all Scots."
