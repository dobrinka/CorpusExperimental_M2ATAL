LONDON: Want to shed the flab? Eat from a red plate and drink from a red cup,
recommends a new study. German and Swiss academics claim that using a red
plate stops people from eating as much food and using red cups also stops pub-
goers from drinking too much alcohol - in fact, it helps reduce food and
drinks consumption by 40%.

They said the colour red may encourage diners to avoid snacking because it is
commonly associated with the idea of "danger, prohibition and stop" , the
Daily Mail reported.

The findings mean the government and food industry could start using red
packaging on unhealthy foods as a deterrent - and could even use more red in
pubs to prevent people drinking too much.

For the study, researchers recruited 41 male students who were asked to drink
tea from cups marked with red or blue labels. The subjects drank 44% less from
cups with red labels.

In the second part, 109 people were given 10 pretzels each on either a red,
blue or white plate. Those with a red plate ate fewer pretzels, say the
researchers . Ursula Arens at the British Dietetic Association said, "Red may
be associated with alarm or something primeval."
