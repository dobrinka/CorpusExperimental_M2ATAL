Despite the media attention that deaths during marathons have garnered,
running long-distance races is not harder on the heart than other activities,
a study concludes.

"This finding provides important reassurance that this is a generally safe and
well-tolerated activity," said Aaron Baggish, director of the cardiovascular
performance program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the lead
author.

###  Video: Centenarian sets marathon record

The study, published in Thursday's edition of the New England Journal of
Medicine, showed that 59 runners suffered cardiac arrests (42 of which were
fatal) among the 10.9 million marathon and half-marathon participants in the
United States from 2000 to 2010.

That works out to one death per 259,000 participants. That is about half the
death rate from cardiac arrest in the general population, one in 125,000.

It also compares favourably to other sporting events such as triathlons, in
which there was one death per 52,620 participants, according to an earlier
study.

Dr. Baggish and his team were able to track down detailed medical information
on 31 runners who experienced heart problems, including the autopsy records of
23 who died. The vast majority, 24, had heart abnormalities, principally
cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the heart muscle. The balance had
atherosclerosis, essentially arteries clogged with plaque.

These underlying conditions are detectable with simple tests, but the
researchers did not recommend mandatory testing before marathons. Dr. Baggish
said the question of widespread testing is controversial because it would be
costly and difficult to enforce.

Beth Abramson, a spokeswoman for the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada,
said there are two simple take-home messages to be taken from the research:
"Over all, marathon running is safe" and "You should discuss your heart health
with your physician before starting an exercise program, including running."

Dr. Abramson, who is a cardiologist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, also
noted: "You don't have to run marathons to be fit."

The average age of runners who suffered from cardiac arrest was 42 and vast
majority - 51 of 59 - were men, according to the study. Of the total
incidents, 40 occurred during marathons (42.2 kilometres) and 19 in half-
marathons (21.1 km).

The researchers noted that, during the decade-long study period, participation
in long-distance running events has soared. More than two million people ran
marathons and half-marathons in the U.S. last year, more than double the
number in 2000. Many of the newcomers are middle-aged or older, a demographic
that has more risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure, high
cholesterol and obesity.

The new research has essentially the same conclusions as an earlier study
conducted by Donald Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at the University of
Toronto. He found 26 deaths among 3.3 million marathon and half-marathon
participants over a 30-year period.

Dr. Redelmeier also showed that almost all the incidents of fatal cardiac
arrest occurred in the last kilometre of races. That is confirmed in the new
research.

One intriguing aspect of the latest research is that it shows 29 per cent of
those who suffered cardiac arrest during a marathon survived; the overall out-
of-hospital survival rate is only 8 per cent.

Dr. Baggish said that is because almost everyone who collapsed during a race
received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from bystanders or medical personnel
who are omnipresent at marathons.

"A key message here is the importance of bystander CPR," he said. As a result,
his team will be offering CPR training to runners, family members and
spectators at this year's Boston Marathon, a practice he hopes will spread to
other events.

About 1.3 million Canadians have heart disease, and 317,500 others are living
with the effects of a stroke. In 2007, the most recent year for which there
are detailed data, 69,503 people died from cardiovascular disease, according
to Statistics Canada.
