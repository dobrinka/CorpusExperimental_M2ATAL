## One in ten Canadians cannot afford prescription drugs: UBC study

One in ten Canadians cannot afford to take their prescription drugs as
directed, according to an analysis by researchers from the University of
British Columbia and the University of Toronto.

The study, published today in the _CMAJ_ _(Canadian Medical Association
Journal)_ is the first to examine the relationship between drug insurance and
the use of prescription drugs in Canada. Researchers from UBC’s Centre for
Health Services and Policy Research reviewed data from 5,732 people who
answered Statistics Canada’s _Canadian Community Health Survey_. They found
that 9.6 per cent of Canadians who received a prescription reported not
filling, failing to refill, or skipping doses for cost reasons. The phenomenon
is particularly prevalent for Canadians who do not have drug insurance, with
26.5 per cent reporting not being able to afford their prescription drugs.

“Our results clearly demonstrate that cost-related problems in accessing
prescription drugs are disproportionately borne by the poor, the sick and the
uninsured,” says Michael Law, Assistant Professor at UBC’s School of
Population and Public Health. “More than one in four Canadians without health
insurance are forced, financially, to go without the prescription drugs they
need.”

Prescription drugs fall outside the Canada Health Act, resulting in a
“patchwork” of drug coverage that leaves two-thirds of Canadian households
paying all or part of their prescription drug costs. The Canadian Institute
for Health Information estimated these out-of-pocket payments totaled $4.6
billion in 2010.

The results of the UBC study show that individuals without drug insurance are
4.5 times more likely to avoid taking prescribed medications because of cost.
Similarly, Canadians with low incomes are 3.3 times more likely to not use
prescription drugs because they cannot afford them.

The study also shows that Canadians who reported fair or poor health status
did not take their prescribed medications 2.6 times more often than those who
reported good or excellent health; similarly, those with chronic conditions
were 1.6 times more likely to not take their medicines as directed due to
cost.

Provincially, those living in British Columbia were more than twice as likely
to report not being able to afford their prescription drugs than those living
in other large provinces. This is a cause for concern, says Law.

“The Canadian most likely to have problems affording their prescription drugs
is in poor health, carries no drug insurance, and lives in British Columbia,”
Law adds.

“As the Provincial Premiers meet in Victoria this week, they should consider
expanding and improving public coverage for prescription drugs to reduce the
influence of cost on whether or not Canadians can afford their prescription
drugs.”
