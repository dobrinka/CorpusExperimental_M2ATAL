# Health bosses backtracking unacceptable - ASMS

"The backtracking by Southern District Health Board over necessary increases
to the number of specialists at Dunedin Hospital's emergency department in
unacceptable," said Mr Ian Powell, Executive Director of the Association of
Salaried Medical Specialists, today.

"Previously Southern DHB had approved an increase of 4.5 emergency medicine
specialists. Now its leaders appear to be backsliding."

"The collective agreement covering senior doctors has a strong expectation
that staffing and other support for them should be consistent with the
standards of their professional colleges. If the DHB was adhering to
professional standards then Dunedin Hospital should have 14 emergency medicine
specialists (currently it has nearly 8) while Invercargill should have over 9
(currently it has 4)." These figures are full-time equivalents.

"Whatever the cause for this backtracking, the government has a responsibility
to sort it. If it is due to under-funding then the government needs to fix it.
If it is due to inadequate management of government funding, then the
government needs to fix this also."

"We are getting increasingly tired of health bosses ducking their
responsibilities and leaving hospital specialists to be increasingly
overworked and overstretched. Dunedin's emergency department is an example but
public hospitals are riddled with this experience across a range of services."

"Senior doctor staffing levels for all public hospital services need to be
consistent with professional standards and should not depend on unacceptable
exploitation," concluded Mr Powell.
