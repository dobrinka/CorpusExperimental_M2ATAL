Lauren was in shock when she realised she was affected

TOWIE star Lauren Pope has revealed that she has the PIP breast implants that
have been at the centre of a health scare for the last few weeks. Lauren - who
was formerly a glamour model - talks about her concern over the implants in
the Tonight show, which is on tomorrow evening.

"The lady that works for my surgeon rang me quite late at night, it was about
ten o'clock when I got the call," former glamour model Lauren tells the show.
"Her phone number came up on my phone and I thought, 'Oh God, it's not going
to be good news'.

  
"She said, 'Just to let you know, you have got those implants, the English
government aren't saying you have to have them out yet, but the French are'.
Because I hadn't really paid attention, I didn't know whether it was really
bad, and so straight away my gut feeling was like, 'Oh my God, I'm going to
have to have another boob job!'"

Lauren with her ex, Kirk Norcross - the pair had his'n'hers nose jobs

  
Understandably Lauren - who used to go out with Celebrity Big Brother's Kirk
when they were both starring in TOWIE - said that she was in shock when she
fully realised what was going on.  
  
"I just thought like, how the hell has this happened? How can 40,000 women be
in the same situation now; where we'll either not have an operation and keep
them in us and think it might be fine, it might not Or we have to now go and
have another major operation that probably none of us really wanted in the
first place."

  
The Silicone Scandal: Tonight is on ITV1 at 7.30pm tomorrow.
