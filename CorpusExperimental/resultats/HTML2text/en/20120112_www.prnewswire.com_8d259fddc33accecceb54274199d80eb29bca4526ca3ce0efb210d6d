LAS VEGAS, Jan. 11, 2012 /PRNewswire/ --

  * Ford, Microsoft Corp. and Healthrageous are researching how connected devices can help people monitor and maintain health and wellness 
  * Trends show people are spending more time in their cars; this new alliance is examining how to extend health management into the personal vehicle in a nonintrusive way 
  * The prototype system developed by BlueMetal Architects leverages Ford SYNCÂ® technology, Microsoft HealthVault, Windows Azure and the interactive services Healthrageous provides in conjunction with compatible biometric measurement devices

Ford, Microsoft, Healthrageous and BlueMetal Architects announced an alliance
today to research technology to help people monitor and maintain health and
wellness while on the move.

The alliance was unveiled during the "Doctor in Your Car" keynote address at
the Digital Health Summit at the International CES.

"People are spending more time in their cars, and with the tremendous growth
in mobile healthcare solutions, Ford is dedicated to understanding the value
of being able to connect to health and wellness-related services while
driving," said Gary Strumolo, manager of Infotainment, Interiors, Health and
Wellness at Ford Research and Innovation. "Our connectivity platform - Ford
SYNC - provides easy, voice-controlled access to mobile devices such as
smartphones and tablets, and therefore it makes sense to research areas that
are important to our customers."

Customer research and societal trends suggest there's a strong business case
for Ford to explore opportunities in health and wellness technology, Strumolo
said.

**Health info online and on the go**

While chronic illnesses are on the rise, the number of healthcare providers
has remained relatively flat, which effectively limits patient access. For
this reason and others, people of all ages and from all income groups are
taking a more hands-on approach to their own health and wellness.

More people now visit online health sites than go to the doctor's office,
making health and wellness the most popular activity on the Web after email
and general searches.

The reasons why are not hard to understand. According to a study conducted by
Pew Research:

  * 93 percent said they seek out online health information because it's convenient - they want to get information on their own timetable, not the doctor's 
  * 83 percent said it's because they can get more information from the Web than they can get from their own doctor 
  * 80 percent said getting this information privately is important to them

Moreover, beginning last year, medical and healthcare was the third-fastest-
growing category of smartphone apps, with more than 17,000 available for
download.

And by 2015, some 500 million people are expected to be using mobile
healthcare apps.

"Taken together, these trends point to a natural role for the automobile in
the emerging digital health and wellness field," Strumolo explains.

**The car that cares**

Strumolo said Ford seeks to develop "the car that cares." As people spend more
time in their cars, the ability to manage health and wellness on the go
becomes more important. There are several reasons why the automobile is an
ideal platform for research and development in this area:

  * It's convenient and private 
  * It facilitates personalized access to the information, products and services people need 
  * And it's a logical place for them to manage their health while they are more often stuck in traffic

The goal is to figure out how to extend health management into the personal
vehicle in a nonintrusive fashion. The prototype system was designed by
BlueMetal Architects.

Using information collected from blood pressure monitors, activity monitors
and glucose meters along with behavioral data shared by the user,
Healthrageous is able to help people lead healthier lifestyles by shedding
unhealthy habits.

Microsoft's contribution is to translate robotic sensory information provided
by the vehicle into an application that also provides a voice and touch-screen
interface, while integrating biometrical data that come from a wearable
device.

Ford SYNC allows this all to be done hands-free.

"This alliance signifies an important step in bringing health innovation into
people's everyday lives," said Todd Bremner, chief technical officer for
BlueMetal Architects. "Ford's SYNC platform allows us to imagine, design and
build natural user experiences leveraging voice and touch, which seamlessly
bring wellness into your everyday commute."

**How it works**

The system would capture biometric and vehicle data as the basis for real-time
health and wellness advice and monitoring.

The driver can provide voice inputs, detailing important aspects of his or her
health routine - such as the number of glasses of water consumed during the
day, or what pills have been taken.

The data received from the driver are then uploaded into the HealthVault
cloud, at which point they are transferred to Windows Azure. The information
is processed with other health data, which are used to create graphical
reports the driver can access after having left the vehicle.

"It's all about making health more accessible, and engaging and thereby
helping more people lead healthier and more enriching lives," said Mary Beth
Chalk, Healthrageous cofounder and chief marketing officer.
