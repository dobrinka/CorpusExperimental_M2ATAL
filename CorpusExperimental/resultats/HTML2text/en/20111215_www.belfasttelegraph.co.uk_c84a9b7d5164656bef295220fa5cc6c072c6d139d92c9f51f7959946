# It's time to get our ailing care system up off its sickbed

_

The Compton health service review is about quality of care, not cost-cutting.
But hard decisions must be taken, says Edwin Poots

_Thursday, 15 December 2011_

Commissioning this review of health and social care is the most important act
of my time as Health Minister to date. Following through with it will be my
priority for the rest of my tenure.

Our health service is vital to everyone in Northern Ireland. We in the
Executive and in the Assembly, as leaders, are duty-bound to protect and
enhance this service.

My primary aim is to drive up the quality of care. Putting the patient first
is the driving force behind Transforming Care - The Review of Health and
Social Care.

My priorities are clear:

  * improve and protect health and reduce inequalities through prevention;
  * improve the quality of services and outcomes for patients, clients and carers;
  * develop more innovative, accessible and responsive services, promoting choice and making more services available in the community;
  * involve individuals, communities and the independent sector in the design, delivery and evaluation of services;
  * improve productivity by ensuring effective and efficient allocation and utilisation of available resources; and
  * ensure that we look after the most vulnerable in our society and the children, the future for this country.

To meet this challenge we must stop doing what does not work, challenge out-
of-date practices and acknowledge that some services are no longer fit for
purpose.

There is no "do-nothing" option. To continue as we are would leave us with an
unsustainable service, with consequences for patient care and safety.

This is why I commissioned this review. I asked for a blueprint for reform.

I laid down a challenge to the review team: to examine the future provision of
services, including our acute hospital configuration, the development of
primary healthcare services and social care and the interface between sectors
to meet our priorities.

This review is not about cost-cutting. It is about quality, accessibility and
safety of patient care. As the financial situation tightens, there needs to be
a radical shift in where and how that money is used.

I am not naive. I have always known that the review would make recommendations
that will be challenging and I will not shirk hard decisions.

However, commissioning this review was not a difficult decision. Indeed, it
would have been irresponsible of me not to do so in light of the issues facing
us.

The proposals in this report represent radical change, which will provide a
more citizen-focused and effective health service.

The evidence - collected through engagement with more than 3,000 people -
speaks for itself. Our people feel that improvements are necessary.

The review proposes a model which places the individual at its centre. Health
and social care services will be increasingly accessible in local areas.

Patients will deal with fewer professionals and will be at the centre of
decision-making about their treatment. There will be a significant shift from
provision of services in hospitals to provision of services in the GP surgery,
closer to home, where it is safe and effective to do this.

Services will regard home as the hub and ensure that people can be cared for
at home, including at the end of life. Where specialist hospital care is
required it will be available - with patients being discharged into the care
of local services as soon as their health and care-needs permit.

The review proposes hospitals will work as a system, with each facility
contributing to the provision of a total service to its population. This will
mean change in all sites over a five-year period. A key aspect of this
approach is that critical clinical staff will be employed to work in a
hospital system and will be a resource for each population working as
necessary across hospital services and facilities.

The review envisages change at several of the current acute hospital sites -
it suggests a likely position, over time, of five to seven major acute
hospital networks in Northern Ireland.

However, the key test for any future service configuration has to be
sustainability and resilience in clinical terms.

It will be on that basis that we are able to determine whether an acute
hospital is viable.

I recognise fully the need for greater productivity from the resources
available to us, particularly in these times of austerity, and it is in that
context that I firmly believe that the greater involvement of frontline
professionals in decision-making and service development is essential. Local
commissioning, too, has a crucial and powerful role to play in driving change
and innovation.

The five commissioning groups, working with the trusts and local communities,
will now have a key role in developing plans by June for their areas to meet
the parameters laid down by the review team. And I want to see a shift in care
currently being carried out in hospitals into the community, with patients
being treated in the right place, at the right time, by the right people.

From today, the challenge is take forward the implementation of this review.
We have been given a path, but we will need leadership to follow. I am
prepared to do just that. The recommendations of this report affect us all, so
I ask you to read it carefully at: www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/hscreview131211.htm.

In doing so, you will better understand the challenge facing us and the
solutions we believe will improve healthcare for us all.

####  • There's not much Christmas cheer for our homeless

Christmas 2011 and never mind no room at the inn - this year they've even
boarded up trade union HQ to keep out the homeless.

####  • Old prejudices have no place in new society

Some people just can't keep out of the news. Take Belfast Lord Mayor Niall O
Donnghaile. There he was, busily planning to host a reception for the brave
bus drivers who kept us all on the move through the Dark Days of the Troubles.

####  • Anthem that divides ill at ease with our goal of unity

If we want a better society, it can't be 'them' and 'us'. It can only be 'all
of us'." I raise these words, spoken by the First Minister, Peter Robinson, at
his party conference, in the face of two recent controversies.

####  • Orange, green and now amber alerts ... no wonder I'm getting alarmed

Last Wednesday, as I was driving along in the car, I heard the BBC weather man
tell us that there was an 'amber' alert for the next day.
