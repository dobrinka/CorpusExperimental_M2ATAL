GMC plans assisted suicide guidance

(UKPA) - 47 minutes ago

The General Medical Council (GMC) is to issue guidance on how to deal with
complaints against doctors who may have assisted in suicides.

Case examiners and the regulator's investigation committee will be advised
about what action to take over allegations that doctors have helped people to
die. There will be a public consultation on the draft guidance once it is
published in January.

It follows a patient asking the GMC what advice or support, if any, doctors
could give to patients who were considering ending their lives.

Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: "The issue of assisted
suicide is complex and sensitive. We already have clear guidance for doctors
that they must always act within the law and assisting or encouraging suicide
remains a criminal offence. This guidance will not in any way change the legal
position for doctors.

"We recognise, however, that there are a range of actions which could be
considered as assisting in a suicide, such as providing information to a
patient about suicide or providing practical assistance for someone to travel
to a clinic such as Dignitas.

"Some of these actions may not lead to criminal charges but may still lead to
complaints to us about a doctor's fitness to practise."

The guidance will include factors that might be relevant in determining the
seriousness of each case. It will not cover euthanasia -in which a doctor's
actions lead to a patient's death - as this is already covered by existing
guidance.

In the last decade, the GMC has examined three cases where a doctor was said
to have helped somebody to die.

One resulted from a conviction for assisting suicide in Canada and none from
any conviction in the UK.
