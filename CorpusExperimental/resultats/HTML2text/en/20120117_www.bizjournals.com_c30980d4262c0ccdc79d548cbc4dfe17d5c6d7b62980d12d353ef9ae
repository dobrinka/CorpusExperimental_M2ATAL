#  Feds to force drug makers to disclose doctor compensation

Drug companies would be required to adopt stringent disclosure policies when
they compensate doctors.

A quarter of doctors take cash payments from drug or device makers and nearly
two-thirds accept routine gifts of food, including lunch for staff members and
dinner for themselves, according to analyses by the _New York Times_ and
others, including the _Business Journal_ and its sister publications.

Now, the Obama administration is set to require drug companies to adopt
stringent disclosure policies when they compensate doctors for everything from
speaking, travel and entertainment to research and consulting, the _Times
_said.

More than 1,100 drug, device and medical supply companies would have to file
reports, the administration said in the report. That will create a large set
of useful new data and allow federal officials to inspect and audit drug
company records to make sure the reports were accurate and complete.
