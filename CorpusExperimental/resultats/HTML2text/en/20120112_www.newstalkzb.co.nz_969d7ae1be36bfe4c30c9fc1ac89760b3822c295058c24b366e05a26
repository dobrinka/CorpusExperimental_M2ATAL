## More details over seized assets in Qld fraud case

By: ARN | Latest International News | Thursday January 12 2012 13:30

The assets of a New Zealander accused defrauding Queensland Health of $11
million have been seized by the Public Trustee.

The seizure happened on Tuesday but the details have just been made public
today.

Lawyers from the Queensland Government want to restrain the assets - including
designer clothes, furniture and framed photos - under suspicion they were
purchased by Hohepa Morehu-Barlow.

The assets were found at the home of the accused's sister, Kelly-Ann Barlow.
