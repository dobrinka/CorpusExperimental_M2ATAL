# Management consultants get £7m to give GPs business skills

Doctors have condemned health service bosses for giving management consultants
such as KPMG and McKinsey £7m to teach business skills to GPs in the latest
diversion of NHS funds to private firms.

NHS London, which oversees the health service in the capital, has been
criticised for paying consultancies up to £1.6m each for training groups of
family doctors how to handle budgets when they take over the commissioning of
care next year.

The British Medical Association (BMA) said the money was going "unnecessarily"
to private companies as existing NHS primary care trusts (PCTs) had the same
skills and should have been given the job instead, blaming the coalition's NHS
shake-up.

"NHS funding is incredibly tight at the moment and this is £7m that's been
spent unnecessarily due to the restructure," said Dr Laurence Buckman,
chairman of the BMA's GPs committee. "There is sufficient expertise within the
NHS in London for them not to have needed to use external companies to do this
and then this money could have been spent elsewhere, ideally on patient care."

An internal NHS London document obtained by the Guardian reveals that, by 28
November last year, contracts worth £6.3m of the £7m had been agreed. The
highest-earning firms were: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) (£1.61m), KPMG
(£1.47m) and McKinsey &amp; Co (£1.27m). Ernst &amp; Young earned the least,
at £332.650.

The biggest individual contracts awarded PWC £852,875 for its work with six
clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in outer north-east London, and McKinsey
£736,500 for passing on skills to personnel in five CCGs in inner north-east
London, the document reveals.

The issue of management consultants being paid to advise the NHS has become
politically charged since Andrew Lansley, a fierce critic of those
arrangements, made a crackdown on such contracts one of his first major
decisions after becoming health secretary in May 2010, and because of the
NHS's ongoing financial squeeze.

Eight firms are advising 38 GP-led CCGs that have been set up across London
and which will replace PCTs in April 2013 and take responsibility for patient
treatment budgets worth billions of pounds. They are ensuring CCGs "have the
business management and leadership expertise need to manage health budgets and
meet the health needs of Londoners, working with their partners such as social
services", said NHS London.

"It was decided just to use external organisations for this. The eight firms
chosen are in a roster to help CCGs prepare for the new [NHS] era. They are,
in effect, preferred suppliers. We want CCGs to learn how to manage budgets so
that, when PCTs have ceased to exist [in 2013], CCGs are up to speed as
organisations in their own right and ready to take on their new
responsibilities," said an NHS London spokesman.

Private firms were offered the work partly because of concern that PCTs across
the capital would not be able to do it after losing up to 2,000 managers
during 2010-11 as part of an NHS-wide drive to reduce management posts, he
added.

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said the fact that only private
firms had been selected to carry out the work in the £7m contract was a sign
of how the revamped NHS would work.

"The prime minister has to justify spending this amount of NHS money on
private firms at a time of great financial challenge. The government is
already wasting £3.45bn on a reckless and unnecessary reorganisation of the
NHS and this forced use of private firms is a worrying sign of things to
come," said Burnham.

NHS London said the £7m represented just 0.6% of its total £1.2bn annual
"multi-professional education and training budget", which is used for training
clinicians, including GPs, and did not affect the delivery of frontline NHS
service.

"Developing highly effective clinical commissioning groups is a big challenge
in a relatively short space of time. Calling on external expertise will give
CCGs the intensive support they need, while helping London's NHS keep a tight
grip on performance in the interim," said an NHS London spokesman.

The Royal College of GPs' Centre for Commissioning has allied itself with
McKinsey over teaching family doctors, even though the college has fiercely
opposed Lansley's radical restructure of the NHS.

A college spokeswoman said: "The RCGP is working with a number of
organisations, including McKinsey, to ensure quality commissioning skills can
be provided to GPs and other healthcare professionals who are keen to embrace
a commissioning role. The college has been involved in providing expertise to
support commissioning, including training."

The Department of Health backed NHS London. "Putting NHS doctors in charge of
their own services means they need the right skills and training to manage
taxpayer's money responsibly. But in making arrangements for that training we
would always urge the NHS to make sure funds were being spent as effectively
as possible", said a spokeswoman.
