Cancer-Stricken Women Lobby For A Bald Barbie

NEW YORK (AP) — Barbie has been an astronaut, an architect, a race car driver
and a news anchor.

Now, there is an online movement to get her to attempt what could be her
biggest feat yet: going bald to fight cancer.

A Facebook page titled "Beautiful and Bald Barbie! Let's see if we can get it
made" was started in late December a few days before Christmas. By Wednesday
afternoon, the page had more than 15,000 fans. The goal is to get toy maker
Mattel Inc. to create a bald Barbie in support of children with cancer.

Friends Rebecca Sypin and Jane Bingham, who live on opposite coasts but have
both been affected by the disease, hatched the idea for the social media
movement because Barbie is an influential children's toy.

Bingham has lost her hair due to chemotherapy treatments to treat lymphoma.
Sypin's 12-year-old daughter, Kin Inich, also lost her hair this year in her
own battle to treat leukemia.

Mattel did not return calls on Wednesday seeking comment, but the women said
they have contacted the company through some general form letters. In return,
they said, they have received form letters that say Mattel does not accept
ideas from outside sources.

The women say a bald Barbie would provide a huge platform to raise awareness
for children with cancer.

Barbie, all 11.5 inches of her, is one of the best-known toys of all time. She
can sell for $10 at Walmart or $7,000 on e-Bay. She has taken on all sorts of
incarnations throughout her nearly 53 years of existence, crushing stereotypes
and showing little girls that they can be whatever they want to be. There has
been an elegant Grace Kelly Barbie; a Barbie in thigh-high pink boots; a
tattooed Barbie; a pregnant Barbie friend, and another Barbie friend in a
wheelchair.

Barbie also has been criticized for not being as socially responsible as she
could have been. She is best known for her curves, which long have sparked
complaints by women's groups who say she imposes an unachievable physical
standard on young girls. She also was lambasted when a talking version uttered
an exclamation about math class being hard.

The friends who started the "Beautiful and Bald Barbie" movement are not
natural activists. Sypin, 32, is a special-education teacher's aide in
Lancaster, California. Bingham, 41, is a photographer in Sewell, New Jersey.

"We're not demanding that the company do anything," Sypin said Wednesday.
"We're just hoping somebody sees this and can help us make it happen."

Overall, Sypin said she has been pleased with the response to the Facebook
page. One fan of the Facebook page wrote about Mattel: "If they are making
dolls that are inspiring young girls with careers then why not make a doll
that would inspire young girls who are dealing with Cancer."

Some commenters suggested the friends take the movement further and extend it
to boys. So, over the weekend, they started an accompanying Facebook page,
"Bald G.I. Joe Movement."

Hasbro Inc., the maker of G.I. Joe, did not immediately return a call for
comment.

The movement has its critics, too.

Some people have told the women to just take a normal Barbie and shave her
hair off to make the same point. Bingham posted photos where she did just that
— resulting in patchy, unattractive clumps on Barbie'shead. She also posted
digitally doctored pictures of a bald Barbie to show how beautiful the doll
could be.

And to people who say that it makes more sense just to donate to cancer
research rather than to buy a bald Barbie?

"A lot of these people wouldn't have even thought about doing that without
this movement," Bingham said.
