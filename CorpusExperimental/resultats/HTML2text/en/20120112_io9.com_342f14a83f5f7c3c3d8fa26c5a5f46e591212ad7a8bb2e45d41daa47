# Predators eat a more balanced diet than you do

![Predators eat a more balanced diet than you do](http://cache.gawkerassets.co
m/assets/images/8/2012/01/medium_408d29f617c81c2496512dc21135ce9f.jpg)When we
imagine great predators like bears, lions, sharks, and the _T. rex_, they're
generally just chowing down on whatever hapless animal wanders in front of
them. But if beetles are anything to go by, predators have a surprisingly
nutritious diet.

Until now, scientists assumed that predators didn't deploy any strategy into
how they ate, other than simply trying to maximize the amount of calories they
assumed. But an international team from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and
Denmark have combined to show that predators are actually much more picky
about the foods they eat than previously imagined.

To test this, the researchers took a bunch of female ground beetles - a
predatory insect that eats everything from slugs and moths to ants and other
beetle larvae - and placed them in two separate containers. In one, the
beetles were presented with a variety of foods, some high in fat while others
were high in protein. The other set of beetles were simply fed whatever the
researchers gave them, and none were given the right balance of fat and
protein.

The first set of beetles consistently put together a balanced diet that
included all the different foods provided. Thanks to this nutritious mixture,
those beetles gave birth to much healthier offspring than their counterparts
who weren't allowed to make choices. This is the first time that any predator
has been shown to seek out a balanced diet, but the researchers believe this
is likely also true of predators throughout the animal kingdom

On some level, this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise - previous
studies of herbivorous and omnivorous insects have shown that they
consistently go for a balanced diet that makes for healthier eggs. But
scientists thought carnivorous predators might be different because they can't
always rely on steady sources of all the different prey they need to eat. Lead
researcher Dr. Kim Jensen of the University of Exeter adds:

> "At a time of year when many of us are focused on healthy eating, it is
interesting to see that predators are also selective about what they eat.
Biologists have previously assumed that predators cannot afford to be fussy
and that they are simply focused on getting the right quantity of food, rather
than quality. We show for the first time that they do actually select the
foods that will give them the right balance of nutrients."
