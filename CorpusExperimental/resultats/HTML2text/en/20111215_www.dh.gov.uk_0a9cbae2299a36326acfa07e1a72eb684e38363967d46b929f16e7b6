# Primary care trust allocations announced

14 December, 2011

The revenue allocations for primary care trusts (PCTs) for 2012-13 are
announced today. The total investment in local NHS services for 2012-13 is
£91.6 billion an increase of £2.5 billion or 2.8 per cent

It includes:

  * £87.5 billion in recurrent revenue allocations to PCTs including an additional £150 million for reablement (assistance regaining independence if daily living skills are lost through illness or injury), an increase of £2.5 billion
  * £4.1 billion in allocations for primary dental services, pharmaceutical services, general ophthalmic services, and to support joint working between health and social care.

**Recurrent revenue allocations**

Recurrent revenue allocations to PCTs are usually determined based on a
weighted capitation formula. The weighted capitation formula determines each
PCT's available resources to enable them to commission similar levels of
healthcare for populations with similar healthcare need, and to reduce
avoidable health inequalities.

To provide the NHS with financial stability in a year of transition, the
weighted capitation formula has not been applied for 2012-13. All PCTs have
received a uniform uplift in their 2012-13 recurrent allocations.

**Future allocations**

Subject to the passing of the Health and Social Care Bill, for 2013-14
onwards, the NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for the allocation of
resources to clinical commissioning groups, while the Department of Health
will make ring fenced grants to local authorities for their public health
responsibilities.
