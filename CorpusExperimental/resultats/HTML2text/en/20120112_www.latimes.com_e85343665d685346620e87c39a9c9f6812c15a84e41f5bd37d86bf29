## Among adults who stopped smoking, those who had used nicotine replacement

Smokers who count on nicotine patches or gum to help them quit may want to
reconsider: A new study finds that these and other nicotine replacement
products aren't effective at preventing former smokers from relapsing in real-
world conditions.  
  
Among 787 adults who had quit smoking within the previous two years, nearly a
third reported having returned to using cigarettes, according to a study
published online Monday by the journal Tobacco Control. Those who had used
nicotine patches, gum, inhalers or nasal sprays were just as likely to relapse
as those who had quit without them, researchers from Harvard University and
the University of Massachusetts found.  
  
The findings run counter to the results of several randomized clinical trials
conducted before the Food and Drug Administration gave the thumbs-up to these
nicotine replacement products in the 1990s. In those trials, volunteers using
such products were up to three times more likely to kick the smoking habit.  
  
But the latest results are in line with other studies that have found little
-- if any -- benefit from the products when used by smokers in real life. In
some cases, studies have found that people who use products like nicotine
patches and gums are more likely to relapse than their counterparts who go
cold turkey.  
  
"This may indicate that some heavily dependent smokers perceive NRT [nicotine
replacement therapy] as a sort of 'magic' pill, and, upon realizing it is not,
they find themselves without support in their quitting efforts, doomed to
failure," the researchers wrote.  
  
The new study examined former smokers three times over a five-year period. At
the midpoint of the study, 30.6% of recent quitters had gone back to smoking.
By the end, 31.3% had relapsed.  
  
American smokers spend more than $1.5 billion on nicotine gum, patches and
related products each year, according to the study. Much of that comes from
public health programs, which are facing further rounds of budget cuts.
Policymakers ought to rethink their willingness to pay for nicotine
replacement therapy, the researchers wrote, and consider shifting that money
to initiatives aimed at discouraging smoking in general, such as anti-smoking
campaigns and efforts to raise tobacco taxes.  
  
But GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, which makes Nicorette, Nicoderm,
Commit lozenges and other smoking cessation products, said that would be
premature. The company noted that most of the adults in the study who used
nicotine replacement products didn't use them for the recommended eight weeks.
Had those people followed directions, they might have had more success.  
  
"Hundreds of clinical trials involving more than 35,000 participants and
extensive consumer use for more than 20 years have proven both the efficacy
and safety of NRT when used as directed," the company said in a statement.
"NRT products have helped millions of smokers quit by gradually weaning them
off of their tobacco addiction and is recommended as a first-line therapy for
quitting."

Well glad we all quit .Truth is I still want them.I always liked it.I just can
not anymore.I say the patch is great for starting to quit I did it two years
prior.It never easy you each are differnt individuals and every day we just
try not to smoke .At leaste I do.

For health reasons, I quit smoking year ago last November without aid of
patches, gums and pills. My physician did prescribe me with Chantix but
decided it was too expensive since my insurance didn't cover it and went cold
turkey. I was surprised how I managed to quit without any withdrawals or urges
since that time.  I was a smoker for over 50 years.  If your health depends on
it, that's a strong enough incentive to quit.  I'm glad I did.  The down side
is, I gained 12 lbs and my waist-line increased 2 inches.

"Nicotine patches, gum don't prevent relapse, study finds"

Nictotine patches and gum are not sold to prevent relapse. There. Can I get
some grant money for this?
