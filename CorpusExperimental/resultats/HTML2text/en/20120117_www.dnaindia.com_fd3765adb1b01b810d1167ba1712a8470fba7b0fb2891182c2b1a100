# Antioxidant-rich foods can prevent diabetes and heart disease

People who eat a diet rich in foods containing powerful antioxidants not only
lower their risk of developing heart disease but can slash their cholesterol
and even get diabetes under control, suggest experts.

The secret lies in a regular dose of potent, health-giving foods rich in
antioxidants called flavonoids.

They are found in abundance in plant-based foods, with onions, apples,
berries, kale, and broccoli having highest concentrations.

They are also found in high amounts in tea, berries, chocolate and even red
wine.

They work by fighting harmful molecules accumulating in the body that damage
healthy cells.

A 12-month trial carried out by scientists at the University of East Anglia
found that diets high in these flavonoids could reduce the risk of heart
disease for women with Type 2 diabetes.

The new study also found that regularly eating flavonoid-rich foods could also
help in the management of diabetes.

The study looked at 93 postmenopausal women with Type 2 diabetes from the age
of 51 to 74. Half were given two small bars of flavonoid-enriched chocolate
each day and half were given placebo chocolate bars.

Those receiving extra flavonoids reduced the risk of a heart attack by 3.4 per
cent.

Their insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were significantly reduced by
the flavonoids.

"These results are significant because they provide further concrete evidence
that diet has a beneficial clinical effect over and above conventional drug
treatment," the Daily Express quoted Professor Aedin Cassidy, of Norwich
Medical School, as saying.

The researchers say further research is needed to examine if similar effects
are seen in men with Type 2 diabetes.

The findings have been published in the journal Diabetes Care.
