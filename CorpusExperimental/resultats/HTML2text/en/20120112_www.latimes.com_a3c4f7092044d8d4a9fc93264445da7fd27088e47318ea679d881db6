Marijuana smoke is not damaging to the lungs like tobacco smoke, study finds.
But that conclusion probably will not change minds in the legalization debate.

Marijuana smoke does not damage lungs in the same manner as tobacco smoke,
according to a study released Tuesday. But that conclusion probably will not
change minds as to whether the drug should be legalized.  
  
The study found that smoking marijuana on an occasional basis does not appear
to significantly damage the lungs. Published in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn., the paper supports previous research that has also failed to
find a link between low or moderate exposure to marijuana smoke and lung
damage. Marijuana contains many of the same chemicals as tobacco smoke.  
  
Researchers led by Mark Pletcher at UC San Francisco studied 5,115 men and
women in four U.S. cities regarding their current and lifetime exposure to
tobacco smoke and marijuana smoke and their lung function. The exposure to
marijuana smoke was expressed by "joint years," with smoking 365 joints or
filled pipe bowls being equal to one joint year.  
  
The study showed that lung function declined with increased exposure to
tobacco smoke. However, that same pattern was not seen with marijuana smoke.
There was no evidence of lung function damage with seven joint years (or
smoking one joint a day for seven years.) After 10 years, there was some
decline in lung function as measured by the speed at which a person can blow
out air.  
  
"Our findings suggest that occasional use of marijuana for [medical] purposes
may not be associated with adverse consequences on pulmonary function,"
Pletcher said in a news release. "On the other hand, our findings do suggest
an accelerated decline in pulmonary function with heavier use -- either very
frequent use or frequent use over many years -- and a resulting need for
caution and moderation when marijuana use is considered."  
  
Understanding the pros and cons of marijuana use is of growing interest as
marijuana usage rates rise and as states considered legalization of marijuana
for medical or even recreational purposes. Pro-legalization advocates said the
study shows marijuana can be used safely.  
  
"To those familiar with the science of cannabis, JAMA's [Journal of the
American Medical Assn.'s] findings should come as no great surprise," said
Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, in a blog post. He adds that marijuana can be used in ways
that avoid most lung irritation.  
  
". . .ingestion of cannabis via alternative methods such as edibles, liquid
tinctures, or via vaporization -- a process whereby the plant's cannabinoids
are heated to the point of vaporization but below the point of combustion --
virtually eliminates consumers' exposure to such unwanted risk factors and has
been determined to be a 'safe and effective' method of ingestion in clinical
trial settings," Armentano said.  
  
However, the National Institute on Drug Abuse maintains marijuana is dangerous
on many other levels, such as by impairing driving and interfering with
learning and brain development when used by adolescents.  
  
"The use of marijuana can produce adverse physical, mental, emotional, and
behavioral effects," said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the institute, writing
on the NIDA website. "It can impair short-term memory and judgment and distort
perception. Because marijuana affects brain systems that are still maturing
through young adulthood, its use by teens may have a negative effect on their
development. And contrary to popular belief, it can be addictive."

I see they didn't include the study supported by The National Institute on
Drug Abuse, in witch UCLA professor Donald Tashkin' not only discovered this,
but found out that not only was there no correlation between pot and lung
cancer, but cigaret smokers who also smoked pot had a less chances of lung
cancer than people who only smoke cigarets. THC kills off cancer cells and old
healthy cells before they turn cancerous. THC not only ballances out the other
nasties you get when you smoke pot, but has enough punch to help keep back
cancer from cigarets. This is an amazing drug. How many times do we have to
knock down lie after lie. Prohibitionists don't have a leg to stand on.

Alcohol has all of those effects, so I'm not seeing the justification for a
ban here.

The article does not state how much damage one cigarette a day for 7 or 10
years does.   Is that what we are comapring, becasue that is the same amount
of substance smoked.  Or is this a pack of cigarettes vs one joint?  If so,
it's rigged to get the answer desired.
