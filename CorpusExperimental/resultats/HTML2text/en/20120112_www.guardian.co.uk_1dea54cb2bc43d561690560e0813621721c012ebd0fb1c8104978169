Nearly three-quarters of family doctors surveyed by the Royal College of
General Practitioners want the government to withdraw the coalition's health
and social care bill, it has emerged.

In an online poll of doctors, 1,900 out of 2,600 respondents said it was
appropriate to pull the legislation even as it wends its way through the House
of Lords. When asked if the college, which represents 44,000 doctors, should
call for the bill to be withdrawn jointly with other medical royal colleges,
more than 98% of respondents said they "strongly supported" or "supported"
such an action.

The figures strengthen the hand of the RCGP chair, Clare Gerada, who wanted to
assess the views of the college membership before pushing forward with her own
line, which has been consistently critical of the bill.

Although the poll was self-selecting, those who answered were largely negative
about the legislation. Nearly 60% said the reforms would not result in more
cost-effective delivery of care and almost 90% said the reforms would increase
the involvement of the private sector.

The college wants the bill to be amended so the secretary of state is
explicitly responsible for the health service and the private sector cannot
cherry pick services.

Gerada said: "The report stage of the bill is expected to be held in the House
of Lords at the end of January, so it is timely for us to reiterate our
concerns and show the government that we want to continue working with them to
bring about positive change for the benefit of our patients."

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said: "These results are
devastating for Andrew Lansley. It is hard to see how he can possibly carry on
with his bill in the face such overwhelming professional opposition. As we
approach the first-year anniversary of the introduction of this bill into
parliament, it is clear that the government's attempts to build a professional
consensus behind it have abjectly failed.

"People will ask how can plans that were meant to be based around GPs can
possibly succeed when only two out of a hundred support them."

A source close to Lansley, the health secretary, dismissed the survey, saying
it was not an opinion poll and therefore "had little credibility". The source
pointed out that 6% of the doctors who replied were from Scotland, and
therefore unaffected by the NHS reforms.
