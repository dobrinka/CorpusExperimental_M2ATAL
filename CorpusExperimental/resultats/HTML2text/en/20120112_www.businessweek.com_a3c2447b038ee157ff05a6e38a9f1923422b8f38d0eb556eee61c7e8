WASHINGTON

Manufacturing problems at a Novartis factory that triggered the recall of four
popular medicines could cost the company between $560 million and $750 million
in lost sales and productivity, a Wall Street analyst estimated Tuesday.

On Sunday the Swiss drugmaker announced the recall of 1,645 lots of Excedrin,
NoDoz, Gas-X and Bufferin from the U.S. market due to reports of chipped and
broken tablets and inconsistent bottle packaging that could cause medicines to
be mixed up. The company previously closed the Lincoln, Neb., facility where
the products were manufactured and says it does not know when operations will
resume. Novartis expects to take a $120 million charge for the fourth quarter
of 2011 related to the recalls.

Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez cut his 2012 sales forecast and full-
year earnings estimate for the company by $560 million and 20 cents per share,
respectively. According to an investment note from Fernandez, the figure
reflects the loss of a year's worth of sales of the recalled products, roughly
$390 million, plus $170 million in lost production from an expected three-
month shutdown of the facility.

The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating manufacturing and
quality-control problems at the plant and is expected to be involved in
approving the restart of operations.

"History suggests that few manufacturing challenges resolve quickly, but a
partial resumption of manufacturing is certainly possible, although a
resumption of manufacturing and a full recovery in the recalled brands are
likely to take considerably longer to resolve, particularly given the FDA's
involvement," Fernandez states.

In a worst-case scenario, Fernandez expects Novartis would lose $750 million
in income if all products manufactured at the Lincoln plant are suspended for
one year. That would be a 30 to 35 cent cut in earnings per share.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Novartis to earn $5.55 per share this
year.

In afternoon trading, U.S.-listed shares of Novartis fell 5 cents to $56.95.
