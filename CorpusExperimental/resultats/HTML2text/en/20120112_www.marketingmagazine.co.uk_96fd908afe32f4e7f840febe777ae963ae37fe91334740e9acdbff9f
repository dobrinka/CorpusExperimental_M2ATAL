McDonald's is giving away millions of copies of children's books by popular
'War Horse' author Michael Morpurgo, as part of a major Happy Meal's campaign
to improve children's literacy.

McDonald's: 2011 'happybox' campaign

The giveaway begins today (11 January) and comes ahead of a new expected TV
campaign by Leo Burnett, which rolls out in February.

McDonald's has secured a deal with book publisher HarperCollins, owned by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, to give away millions of copies of
Morpurgo's 'Mudpuddle Farm' children's books with Happy Meal purchases.

Murpugo is the author of 'War Horse', which has been made into a film by
Steven Spielberg and launches in cinemas this weekend.

The McDonald's campaign is supported by the National Literary Trust, as well
as Jade Goody's ex-boyfriend Jeff Brazier, who is acting as an ambassador for
the campaign.

In total, six titles from HarperCollin's 'Mudpuddle Farm' range will be made
available during the promotion.

The move could come in for criticism from some quarters, who will argue
McDonald's is offering sweeteners for parents and children to buy Happy Meals.

Jonathan Douglas, director of the National Literacy Trust, said: "We are very
supportive of McDonald's decision to give families access to popular books, as
its size and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to
read together."
