A charge of widespread scientific fraud, involving 26 articles published in 11
journals, was leveled by the University of Connecticut today against Dipak K.
Das, one of its researchers, whose work reported health benefits in red wine.

Dipak K. Das in 2006. Fraud allegations against him, if verified, seem
unlikely to affect the field of resveratrol research itself, because his work
was peripheral to its central principles.

Many of the articles reported positive effects from resveratrol, an ingredient
of red wine thought to promote longevity in laboratory animals.

The charges, if verified, seem unlikely to affect the field of resveratrol
research itself, because Dr. Das's work was peripheral to its central
principles, several of which are in contention. "Today I had to look up who he
is. His papers are mostly in specialty journals," said David Sinclair, a
leading resveratrol expert at the Harvard Medical School.

The significance of the case seems more to reflect on the general system of
apportioning research money. Researchers complain that federal grants are
increasingly hard to get, even for high-quality research, yet money seemed to
have flowed freely to Dr. Das, who was generating research of low visibility
and apparently low quality. The University of Connecticut said Wednesday that
it was returning two new grants to Dr. Das, worth a total of $890,000, to the
federal government.

The agency that granted the funds was the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute. Renate Myles, a spokeswoman, said in response that scientific
misconduct "can go undetected for a length of time even under the most
rigorous systems of research oversight and review."

The investigation of Dr. Das's work began in January 2009, two weeks after the
university received an anonymous allegation about research irregularities in
his laboratory. A special review board headed by Dr. Kent Morest of the
University of Connecticut has now produced a 60,000-page report, which has
been forwarded to the Office of Research Integrity, a federal agency that
investigates fraud by researchers who receive government grants.

According to a 60-page summary of the report, Dr. Das's published research
articles were found to contain 145 instances of fabrication and falsification
of data. Many involved cutting and pasting photographic images from a type of
research record known as a western blot. Because western blots have often been
subject to manipulations in the past, many journals require that the images
not be altered in any way without an explicit description of the procedure.

Dr. Das did not answer his phone at the university or respond to e-mail.

The university has sent a copy of its report to the editors of the 11 journals
that published the suspect articles.

Adam Marcus, who edits the blog Retraction Watch, an inventory of the growing
number of discredited scientific reports, said he would be monitoring the
journals to see whether retractions were issued, a step that some editors are
reluctant to take.

Dr. Das was a prolific publisher of research. His name appears on 588 articles
listed in Google Scholar, though some may be by other researchers with the
same name and initials. Most of the articles concern the effect of drugs on
the heart, including 117 articles on resveratrol.
