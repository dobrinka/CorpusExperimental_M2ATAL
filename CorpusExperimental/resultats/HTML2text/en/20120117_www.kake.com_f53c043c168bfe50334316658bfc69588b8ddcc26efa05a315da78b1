**Monday, January 16, 2012**

The first H1N1 flu case of the season has been reported at a Wichita hospital.

Wesley Medical Center officials said the hospital treated its first influenza
A, or H1N1, patient over the weekend.

Symptoms include body aches, chills, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting.
Others may also include dry cough, runny nose and a sore throat. Symptoms can
last for up to seven days.

The flu is an airborne virus, easily spread through the nose, throat and
lungs.

Doctors recommend a flu shot to prevent catching the virus. Hand washing,
covering coughs and avoiding contact with your eyes, nose and mouth is also
recommended.
