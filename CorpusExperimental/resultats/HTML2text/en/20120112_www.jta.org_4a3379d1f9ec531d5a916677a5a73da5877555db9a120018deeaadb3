## Doctors ordered to pull out of gender-separated conference

January 10, 2012

JERUSALEM (JTA) -- The Israel Medical Association has barred its member
physicians from participating in an infertility conference geared for haredi
Orthodox men and women that did not invite female speakers.

The annual Innovations in Gynecology and Halacha conference of the Puah
Institute for Medicine and Halacha is scheduled for Wednesday. Some 1,000 men
and women are expected to attend the conference, which is geared to the Modern
Orthodox and haredi Orthodox communities. Male and female participants are
separated by dividers in the conference hall.

The conference has been held for the last 12 years, but this marks the first
time that the absence of female speakers has become an issue. Women do not
serve as speakers, according to the organization, in order to insure the
participation of the haredi Orthodox, who are generally wary of medical
advancements in fertility treatments.

In response to the criticism, the Institute announced Monday that it would
hold an event for women only in the summer, and will make it an annual event
tied to the existing conference.

At least eight doctors reportedly had pulled out of the conference prior to
the medical association's announcement Monday, though replacements had been
found, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Puah has in the past received subsidies from the Ministry of Health, but not
this year, The Jerusalem Post reported.

"We are sorry that instead of appreciating the great advances we have merited
to see in women's health in general, and in particular within the religious
sector, as a result of our conferences, there are cynical, aggressive elements
who try to block us by using the prevailing public ambience," the organization
said on its website. "These elements are riding on the back of the Puah
Institute in order to advance their personal agenda."

The Puah Institute, a non-profit organization, was founded in 1990 by former
Sephardic Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu in an effort to help Orthodox couples
overcome infertility. In the Bible, Puah is one of the midwives who continued
to deliver Jewish babies in Egypt and save the males after Pharaoh decreed
they should be drowned in the Nile at birth.
