A Zimbabwean tourism company has suspended bungee jumps at Victoria Falls
while they investigate an accident in which an Australian tourist plunged into
the Zambezi River, a spokesman said on Thursday.

"We voluntarily suspended bungee jumping for two days [from Wednesday] to
allow an audit of the accident that happened" after a cord snapped, Shearwater
Adventures spokesman Clement Mukwasi said.

"This was to allow the auditors, management and crew the opportunity to
analyse the causes of the broken cord and review the new system and procedures
without distractions."

Jumps could resume from the weekend, he added.

On New Year's Eve, 22-year-old Australian Erin Langworthy jumped from the
Victoria Falls bridge and fell headfirst into the Zambezi River, 111 metres
below.

The hair-raising accident was caught on video and Ms Langworthy is seen
hitting the water with her feet still tied before being swept towards rapids
on the river, which separates Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Ms Langworthy managed to avoid any crocodiles and swim to the Zimbabwe side of
the river, where she hauled herself out.

She suffered a fractured collar bone and severe bruising and was taken to
South Africa for treatment.

Mr Mukwasi said "all other activities including bridge swings, slides tours
and the restaurant facility will continue as normal."

Zambia's tourism minister Given Lubinda on Sunday took a bungee jump in an
attempt to assure tourists of its safety.

Tourism is the lifeblood of the towns of Victoria Falls and Livingstone in
Zambia, where upmarket resorts attract visitors from around the world.

Mr Mukwasi said the probability of an accident was one in 50,000 jumps a year.
