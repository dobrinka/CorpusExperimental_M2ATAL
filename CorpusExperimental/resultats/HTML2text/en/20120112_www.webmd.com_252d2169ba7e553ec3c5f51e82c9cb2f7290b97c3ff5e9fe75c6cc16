## IVF: Are 3 Embryos Too Many to Transfer?

No Justification for More Than 2, Study Finds

Jan. 11, 2012 -- Transferring more than two embryos during an IVF cycle is a
dangerous practice that does not improve a woman’s chances of delivering a
baby, a European study finds.

Researchers analyzed close to 125,000 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles
performed in the U.K. over a five-year period in one of the largest studies
ever to compare outcomes in women younger than 40 to those of older women.

The conclusion that there is no medical justification for transferring three
or more embryos, even in women over the age of 40, has major implications in
the U.S., where 1 in 3 IVF procedures involves the transfer of more than two
embryos.

### 3 Embryos: 1 Too Many?

While that represents a decline from a decade ago, when closer to 2 out of 3
IVF procedures in the U.S. involved three or more embryos, there is still
plenty of room for improvement, a study co-author says.

“The practice of transferring multiple embryos is very much market-driven in
the United States,” says Scott M. Nelson, MD, PhD, of the University of
Glasgow Centre for Population and Health Sciences. “There is an economic
incentive for transferring more embryos in the U.S., but no sound medical
reason for doing so.”

New York infertility specialist Glenn L. Schattman, MD, disagrees. Schattman
is president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART).

SART guidelines call for the transfer of one or two embryos per IVF cycle in
younger patients with the best prognosis, and as many as four embryos per
cycle in patients in their late 30s and 40s with a poor chance of achieving a
pregnancy.

He says it is clear from SART’s own statistics that the poorest-prognosis
patients have a much better chance of having a baby when more than two embryos
are transferred.

“There is a continuous and constant decline in fertility with increasing age,
so it makes no sense to treat a 39- or 40-year-old the same way we would a 26
-year-old,” he says.

### Lower Birth Rates Seen With 3 Embryos

The 124,148 IVF cycles analyzed by Nelson and colleague Debbie A. Lawlor, PhD,
of the University of Bristol, resulted in 33,514 live births.

The live birth rate was greater with the transfer of two embryos, compared to
one, in women under the age of 40 and in women who were older. Transferring
three embryos resulted in a lower birth rate than transferring two in the
younger women and made no difference in outcomes in older women.

Compared to single-embryo transfer, transferring two or three embryos was
associated with a higher risk for all adverse birth outcomes, including low
birth weight and preterm delivery.

Not surprisingly, the overall live birth rate was lower in older women
compared to younger ones, no matter how many embryos were transferred.

“A clear implication of our study is that [the] transfer of three embryos
should no longer be supported in women of any age,” Nelson and Lawlor write.
