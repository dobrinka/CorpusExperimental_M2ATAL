At least 50 Greek women with French implants

(AFP) - 5 hours ago

ATHENS -- At least 50 women in Greece have used breast implants made by
defunct French manufacturer PIP that have shown abnormally high rates of
rupture, a newspaper said on Thursday.

Ta Nea daily, citing health ministry sources, said at least 250 implant pairs
made by Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were sold to surgeons between 2009 and
2010 and that at least 50 women had implants fitted.

"Very soon these women will be located and they will be informed by their
surgeons of the need for a re-examination," health ministry general secretary
Antonis Dimopoulos told the daily.

Around 300,000 women in 65 countries are believed to have received PIP
implants, deemed a risk to health after the discovery that the company used an
illegal industrial-grade gel that, according to French investigators, has led
to abnormally high rates of ruptured implants.

More than 450 lawsuits have been filed in three countries, and French police
have placed PIP and its founder Jean-Claude Mas, 72, under investigation.

Not all state authorities have found the scare credible.

France, Germany, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands have recommended that
the devices be removed as a precaution but Britain has said it will not follow
suit.

Thirteen countries in Europe and Latin America have urged women to have a
checkup. In two of them of them -- Bolivia and Venezuela --- the state is
offering operations to have the implants removed, but has not made this a
recommendation.

In contrast, Australia says it found no evidence that the implants posed a
risk.
