# Cancer detecting dye could âsave many livesâ

Tuesday, January 17, 2012

A FLUORESCENT dye that pinpoints the tiniest sign of cancer when sprayed onto
the oesophagus (the food pipe) could detect the disease earlier - potentially
saving many lives, Cambridge scientists have discovered.

Oesophageal cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the UK. Around 8,000
people a year are diagnosed with it.

The number of men diagnosed with it has risen by more than 50 per cent in a
generation.

The research, conducted at the Medical Research Council Cell Unit in
Cambridge, in collaboration with Cancer Research UKâs Cambridge Research
Institute, shows when sprayed onto the oesophagus the dye sticks to normal,
healthy, cells but not to cancer cells or those in the early stages of turning
cancerous. This gives an early warning of where the cancer is developing and
can spare patients radical surgery.

At this point the cancer can be treated with radiofrequency ablation â an
electrical current applied to the affected area to kill the cancer cells.

Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald, lead author based at the MRC Cancer Cell Unit in
Cambridge, said: âCurrent methods to screen for oesophageal cancer are
controversial â they are costly, uncomfortable for the patient and are not
completely accurate. Our technique highlights the exact position of a
developing oesophageal cancer, and how advanced it is, giving a more accurate
picture.â

Professor Kevin Brindle, a researcher at Cancer Research UKâs Cambridge
Research Institute, said: âThe benefit of using this dye is that it is
specific, relatively cheap and is found in our normal diets so unlikely to
cause any unwanted effects at the levels we use. We now need to test our
technique in newly diagnosed patients.â

Dr Julie Sharp, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK,
said: âOesophageal cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect and
treat, with only eight per cent of people with the disease surviving at least
five years. We urgently need new ways to detect the cancer earlier, and this
dye offers a great opportunity to treat the cancer more promptly and more
successfully, potentially saving many lives a year.â
