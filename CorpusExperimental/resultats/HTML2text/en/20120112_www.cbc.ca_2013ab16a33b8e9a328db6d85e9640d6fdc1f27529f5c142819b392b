Stroke and atrial fibrillation study, New England Journal of Medicine

An irregular heartbeat that isn't felt but is detected by a pacemaker may
point to an increased risk of stroke, a new study suggests.

The study in Wednesday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine looked
at 2, 580 people aged 65 or older with hypertension and no history of a type
of irregular heartbeat called atrial tachyarrhythmia. That's a heart that
races to more than 190 beats per minute. ![Pacemaker investigator Dr. Stuart

Dr. Jeff Healey and Dr. Stuart Connolly of McMaster University in Hamilton,
and their co-authors were interested in exploring possible reasons for the
quarter of strokes that currently have no known cause.

"This study suggests that silent atrial fibrillation is very common and may be
the cause of many strokes that previously could not be explained," Healey
said. "In all, atrial fibrillation may be responsible for nearly one in five
strokes."

In the study, participants in 23 countries who'd had a pacemaker implanted
were followed for an average of 2 Â½ years.

In that time, 11 of the 261 patients or 4.2 per cent had a subclinical or
silent atrial fibrillation detected by their pacemaker within three months and
had an ischemic stroke or a serious heart complication called systematic
embolism, the researchers found.

The silent heart problem was also detected at least once during the follow-up
time in nearly 35 per cent of people.

Silent atrial tachyarrhythmias increased the risk of ischemic stroke or
systematic embolism by 2.5 times, after taking into account other risk factors
such as age, sex, previous strokes and history of Type 2 diabetes and heart
disease, Healey's team concluded.

The study was funded by pacemaker manufacturer St. Jude's Medical. Several
authors said they'd received fees from pacemaker and defibrillator makers.
