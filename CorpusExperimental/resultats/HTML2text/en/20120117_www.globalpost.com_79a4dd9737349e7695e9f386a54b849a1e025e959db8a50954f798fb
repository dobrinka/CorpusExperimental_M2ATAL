The number of pedestrians wearing headphones who were seriously injured or
killed near roadways and railways has tripled in six years, a new US study
shows.

According to Bloomberg Businessweek, between 2004 to 2005, the number of
headphone-wearing pedestrians who were seriously injured was 16. By 2011, the
number had increased to 47. According to the study, published in the journal
Injury Prevention, in 34 of the 116 cases mentioned, horns or sirens were
sounded before the victims were struck.

The majority of incidents involved young men under the age of 30, most of whom
where in urban counties. More than half of the injuries occured with trains,
not motor vehicles, the LA Times reported.  

The lead researcher on the study, Richard Lichenstein at the University of
Maryland Hospital for Children, explained that "Sensory deprivation that
results from using headphones with electronic devices may be a unique problem
in pedestrian incidents, where auditory cues can be more important than visual
ones."

However, while the study doesn't show causation or correlation of headphone
use and pedestrian risk, the authors point to two factors that could cause the
assocation between headphone use and injury. The first is sensory deprivation,
and the second is "inattentional blindness," which refers to how the use of
electronic gadgets can decrease our attention to the things around us.

The authors used the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System and the
US Consumer Product Safety Commission databases, along with Google News
Archives and the Westlaw Campus Research records, as sources for the survey.
