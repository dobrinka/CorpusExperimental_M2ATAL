# Heart Attack Risks Soar for Grieving Loved Ones

Scientists have found new evidence that grief might actually break your heart.
A new study shows that people grieving the death of a close loved one could
have a heart attack risk that is 20 times higher than normal.

When researchers interviewed nearly 2,000 people in the early 1990s who were
hospitalized after a heart attack, 270 reported that they had experienced the
death of a parent, sibling, spouse, friend or other loved one in the six
months before their heart attack; almost 20 people had experienced a loss
within the past day.

The authors calculated the risk of a heart attack as 21 times higher in the
first day after the loss of a loved one, and six times higher during the week
after such a loss.

The study was published today in the American Heart Association's journal
Circulation.

While previous studies have shown that the death of a loved one is linked to
worsening health over time, the latest study is the first to show that the
effects can begin so immediately and strongly after a loss, findings that
surprised lead author Elizabeth Mostofsky and her colleagues.

"The risk was high not only the following day, but also remains high for quite
some time," Mostofsky said, noting that the risk was also higher if the person
said the loss was moderately or extremely significant to them.

Studies have shown that people can and do suffer from "broken heart syndrome,"
called takotsubo, a condition in which heart attacks occur in the face of
abrupt, stressful news or events. Scientists aren't entirely sure how shock or
grief lead to a heart attack but, most likely, emotional stress boosts levels
of stress hormones and other factors that can increase heart rate, blood
pressure, blood clotting and other factors that put the heart at risk.

Broken heart syndrome is more common among older women, but in the latest
study, the grieving heart attack survivors were mostly younger men. Dr. Cindy
Grines, vice president of academic and clinical affairs at the Detroit Medical
Center Cardiovascular Institute, noted that many of them had more typical
causes of heart attack, such as ruptured plaques or blood clots in their
arteries, and might not have experienced classic takotsubo, when heart attacks
usually occur with no typical causes.

But she said she doesn't doubt that many of their heart attacks might have
been tied to grief.

"I have had several patients come in with heart attacks shortly after the
death of a spouse," Grines said, including a 38-year-old man who reported
chest pains shortly after witnessing the death of his wife.

The man delayed treatment to make funeral arrangements, and when he finally
went to the hospital, he had a major blood clot in his artery. "If he had been
seen early, started on aspirin and other medications, this clot would not have
become so large," Grines said.

Mostofsky said such cases might be typical among grief-stricken people, who
might stop taking medications, delay treatment or dismiss heart attack warning
signs after the death of a loved one.

"Although they may be experiencing the symptoms of loss, they shouldn't
attribute symptoms to stress alone," Mostofsky said. "They should take this
seriously and realize these could be symptoms of a heart attack and they
should seek care."

The study notes that grief-related heart attack is still a relatively rare
occurrence, compared with other triggers such as physical activity or episodes
of anger. But Dr. Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital, said doctors should take it into consideration when they are
treating patients.

"It is sufficiently common that practitioners should be sensitized to its
likelihood," Yancy said. "We should not miss those treatment opportunities as
a means of preventing this clustering of events."

Heart attack symptoms include chest discomfort, stomach pain, shortness of
breath, nausea and lightheadedness, according to the American Heart
Association. Patients with such symptoms should report them immediately.
