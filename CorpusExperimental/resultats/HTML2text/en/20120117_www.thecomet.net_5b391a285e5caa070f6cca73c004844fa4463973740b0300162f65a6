# Watchdog slams care at hospital for vulnerable adults

Richard Young  Tuesday, January 17, 2012

A health service watchdog has heavily criticised a hospital after inspectors
found allegations of abuse were not being properly responded to, while staff
were disrespectful to patients and had no clear understanding of restraint.

The Care Quality Commission issued a formal warning to Walkern Lodge â a
private care home for women with learning disabilities in Stevenage and said
it must improve standards or face legal action.

The surprise inspection in late November found employees at the home which
provides clinical care and rehabilitation services for up to six women, lacked
proper measures to safeguard them. Staff were seen speaking in a disrespectful
way to residents, did not deal appropriately with concerns and allegations of
abuse, and did not demonstrate a clear understanding of restraint.

âWhere restraint was being used this was not recognised as restraint. No
records were being kept so the level of restraint being used in the service
could not be monitored,â a commission spokesman said.

The report also said the hospitalâs policy on safeguarding residents was
drawn up for GP practices and unsuited to the home. Staff were unaware how to
make a referral to Herts County Council or of their responsibilities to
safeguard vulnerable adults. Incidents that should have been reported to the
local authority and the commission had not been.

Frances Carey, CQC regional director, said: âThe law says these are the
standards that everyone should be able to expect. Providers have a duty to
ensure they are compliant.â

She added: âWe have received an action plan from the owner of Walkern Lodge
in relation to the concerns raised and we will be returning to the hospital to
follow up on progress. When we do, we will expect the hospital to be able to
demonstrate it has made improvements.

âThis warning sends a clear message that Walkern Lodge needs to address
these issues or face serious consequences.â

The commission has a range of legal powers it can use if the required
improvements are not shown to be in place by Friday, including fines, reducing
the services, and closing the home down.

A spokesman for care group Cambian which runs Walkern Lodge, said it was
working with the commission and the Herts County Council and North Herts and
Stevenage Community Learning Disability safeguarding team to remedy the
situation.

âWe are working collaboratively through a transparent and open dialogue and
have developed a clear action plan to address these concerns. We have made
immediate changes to staff, training and administration reporting systems. We
are confident that these changes will receive full approval on the return CQC
visit.

âWe have also discussed the content of the CQC report with the relevant
primary care trusts that use this service. They are satisfied with the action
that we are taking and continue to have confidence in this service. Further to
the CQC visit, a further two unannounced visits have been undertaken by two
primary care trusts. The inspectors from one of these commented that they are
âconfident that service users are safe at Walkern Lodge and being treated
with dignity and respectâ.â
