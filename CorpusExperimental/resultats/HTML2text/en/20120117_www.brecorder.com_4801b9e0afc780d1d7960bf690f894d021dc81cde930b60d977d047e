Administrator KMC Muhammad Hussain Syed has said that an effective law to deal
with the major problem of graffiti (wall chalking) had been suggested so that
those who indulged in mutilating the city's face could be awarded with strict
punishment.  
  
He said this while talking about the cleanliness, beautification and wall
chalking in the city, according to a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC)
statement on Sunday.

Administrator Karachi said it was decided in a meeting chaired by the Sindh
Governor to bring in such a law under which the persons involved in wall
chalking on residential houses and buildings could be charged with non-
bailable offence and punished.  
  
Draft for this law has already been prepared.  
  
He said KMC often carries out campaigns for removal of the chalking on walls
and ban on such activity was enforced under Section 144 Cr.  
  
PC.

He said the district municipal administrations were already directed to clean
the graffiti, so that these ugly blots on the face of city could be removed.
