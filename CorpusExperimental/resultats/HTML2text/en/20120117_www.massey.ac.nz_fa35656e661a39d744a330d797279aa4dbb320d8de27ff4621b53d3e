# Resolving conflict an issue for many franchises

![flint-

Dr Susan Flint-Hartle, Senior Lecturer, School of  
Economics and Finance, Massey University,  
Albany campus

A new study into the causes and experience of conflict in the franchise sector
shows that New Zealand franchisees can be disappointed with their franchising
experience.  
  
Towards Understanding and Resolving Conflict: Franchising in New Zealand 2011
was produced by Massey University and is the first major report to focus on
conflict in the franchise relationship undertaken in New Zealand.  
  
A significant number of those surveyed said their experience of franchising
did not live up to their initial expectations, and the report highlighted
communication and conflict resolution as the key areas that franchisors need
to improve. The results of the current study however revealed a more complex
situation.  
  
"What is interesting is that franchisees have a very different view to
franchisors over how satisfying the relationship is," says Dr Susan Flint-
Hartle, a senior lecturer at Massey's School of Economics and Finance, and
author of the report. "In our 2010 report on the sector, franchisors reported
a low incidence of conflict and that their franchisees were, on the whole,
very happy."  
  
It was found that less than half of franchisees believed they had conducted
sufficient due diligence before committing themselves, and the majority felt
their interests were not addressed equally when conflict arose.  
  
"Resolving conflict was revealed as a problem area," the report says. "In
general it can be said that conflict is not well handled by franchisors and
often the outcomes are seen as unsatisfactory by franchisees."  
  
Over a quarter of the franchisees surveyed said they had experienced conflict
with their franchisor at one time or another. The major causes of disputes
included too much franchisor control, a lack of profitability, and what
franchisees considered to be unfair franchise agreements.  
  
Of those involved in a dispute, nearly 40 per cent said their conflict was
never resolved, and a further 28 per cent viewed their resolution as
unsatisfactory. The report notes that very few franchises offer formal
conflict training, and 42 per cent did not have a formal dispute resolution
process.  
  
Dr Flint-Hartle believes there is much for franchisees and franchisors to
learn from the report if they wish to have more productive business
relationships. Prospective franchisees, she says, need to get a better
understanding of what owning a franchise is going to be like.  
  
"There are currently no pre-education programmes for would-be franchisees in
New Zealand, which is something that Massey has been working towards," she
says. "This report provides impetus for getting that programme in place."  
  
Franchisors, on the other hand, could benefit by actively delivering on the
promises they make when they sell their franchises, and be more aware of how
their franchisees are faring, especially during the tough business conditions
that exist at present says Dr Flint-Hartle.  
  
"If two businesses are working happily together, they will be more productive
and profitable," she explains. "That is important because the franchise sector
not only provides employment for thousands of New Zealanders but contributes
significantly to the New Zealand economy."  
  
The study will be followed up later this year by Massey University's second
Franchising New Zealand report. Carried out jointly with Brisbane's Griffith
University and the Asia Pacific Centre for Franchising Excellence, the
biennial report looks at the growth, turnover, challenges and contribution of
the franchise sector to the New Zealand and Australian economies. Surveys will
be conducted mid-year, with the report being published at the end of 2012.  
  
Summary for editors:  
Towards Understanding and Resolving Conflict presents the results of a
national survey of New Zealand franchisees, conducted by Massey University
researchers in mid 2011. The study explores the perceived levels of conflict
in the franchise relationship, the types of conflict, and the causes.  
  
Key statistics from the study include:  

  * Some 51 per cent of franchisees had their expectations of franchising met, 25 per cent did not and 25 per cent expressed no opinion.
  * Only 48 per cent of franchisees felt they had conducted sufficient due diligence before purchasing their franchise.
  * 44 per cent of franchisees spent less than one month researching their franchise opportunity.
  * Only 44 per cent of franchisees were satisfied with the completeness of the communication they received.
  * Only 40 per cent of franchisees felt they could rely on their franchisor to help them if they faced difficulties.
  * 23 per cent felt the relationship with their franchisor was not 'fair'.
  * 20 per cent of franchisees experienced frequent disagreements with their franchisor, although only 12 per cent reported intense disagreement.
  * When conflict arose, only 29 per cent of franchisees felt there was a satisfactory resolution.
