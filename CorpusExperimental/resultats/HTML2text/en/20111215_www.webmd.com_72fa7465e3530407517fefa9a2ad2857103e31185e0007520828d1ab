## HPV Test Beats Pap Test for Cervical Cancer Screening

In Women Over 30, HPV Testing Finds More Precancers, Study Shows

Dec. 15, 2011 -- A test that looks for the virus that causes most cases of
cervical cancer may be the best way to screen women over age 30 for the
disease, a new study shows.

The study followed 45,000 women ages 29 to 56 in the Netherlands who were
split into two groups. The first group got a traditional Pap test to look for
cervical cancer. The second group got a Pap test along with a newer test for
human papillomavirus (HPV). Studies have shown that HPV causes more than 90%
of all cervical cancers.

Five years after they were first screened, all women were rescreened using
both Pap and HPV tests.

In the first round of testing, HPV tests detected significantly more
precancerous changes to cervical cells than Pap testing alone.

Because doctors caught and treated those changes sooner, women who initially
got HPV tests were less likely to have full-blown cervical cancer when they
were tested again five years later compared to women who got Pap tests alone.

The study found that women who got an initial HPV test had about a 27% reduced
risk of having advanced precancerous lesions five years later compared to
women who had a Pap test alone.

They were also less likely to have cervical cancer. There were 14 cases of
cancer found in the group that only got a Pap test at the start of the study
compared to four cases in the women who also got an HPV test.

What's more, the numbers of high-grade precancerous lesions found over time in
the study didn't significantly differ between the two groups. Experts say that
suggests that adding HPV testing didn't pick up infections that would have
likely cleared on their own. That should eliminate any worry that HPV testing
would lead to overtreatment, they contend.

### A New Way of Screening?

The study, which is published in _The Lancet_, suggests that starting HPV
testing at age 30 may benefit women along with routine Pap testing for
cervical cancer.

Some experts project that HPV testing could one day replace Pap tests as the
primary way doctors look for cervical cancer.

“I think for screening purposes, you can test by HPV alone,” says researcher
Chris J.L.M. Meijer, MD, PhD, a pathologist at VU University Medical Center in
Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women get Pap tests
every three years between ages 21 and 65.  The task force says more evidence
is needed before HPV screening alone or in combination with Pap testing is
widely adopted for women 30 and older.

But experts who are updating those recommendations say they may reconsider
both the testing interval and the value of HPV screening based on the results
of this study.

“I don’t take care of that many women who are anxious to have their Pap
smear,” says Michael LeFevre, MD, MSPH, who is co-vice-chair of the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force panel that is scheduled to issue final cervical
cancer screening guidelines in 2012.

“If you can accomplish the same outcome with a much lower burden of testing to
the individual woman, then you have to view that as positive,” says LeFevre,
who is also a professor of family medicine at the University of Missouri in
Columbia.
