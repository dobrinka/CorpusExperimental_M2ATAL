Could India be free of the highly infectious wild poliovirus? The signs are it
may well be so, with the last case of poliomyelitis having been reported in
West Bengal exactly a year ago. It is a rare, inspiring triumph for India in
healthcare, with amped-up, extensive awareness and implementation programmes
working in tandem. These have ensured that precious drops of oral poliovirus
vaccine repeatedly reached children in cities and villages. The drive was
active even on trains and buses, for children of mobile population like
migrant workers.

A debilitating disease that affects the nervous system, especially of children
below five years, with 1 in 200 chances of acute paralysis, polio has no cure.
It can only be vaccinated against. And that has been the great hurdle for a
country considered one of the epicentres of the wild poliovirus (to
distinguish it from the vaccine virus): India reported 741 cases in 2009, the
highest in the world that year. Since 1988, with the launch of the Global
Polio Eradication Initiative, the battle has been against three types of wild
poliovirus. Type 2 was eradicated in just over a decade; type 3, after a
furious outbreak in 2009 and a consequent intense immunisation drive, was
reported last in India in 2010; and now the last case of type 1 was reported
on January 13, 2011  the year-long break the reason for this collective sigh
of relief.

India could soon be taken off the list of four countries considered endemic to
polio in 2011  Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria being the other three. To
understand the tenacity of the global fight against polio, consider the number
of polio-endemic countries in 1988: over 125. However the challenge for India
now is to sustain this drive against the wild poliovirus that is known to
circulate before striking pockets of children with low immunity levels. India
will have to record at least two more years of zero-polio case to be
recognised as polio-free. Equally importantly, the diligence and doggedness of
this fight against the wild poliovirus should be a template for our other
healthcare programmes, including against malnutrition.
