(Updates with lawmakers' letter in fourth paragraph.)

Jan. 10 (Bloomberg) -- A listeria outbreak that killed 30 people and sickened
another 146 may have been avoided if a Colorado cantaloupe processor had
followed U.S. guidelines and washed the fruit in chlorinated water, a
congressional investigation found.

Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado, also added new processing equipment that
may have led to contamination, according to the report issued today by the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The Food and Drug Administration, which oversees produce, doesn't have
specific regulations for cantaloupe processing and offers only guidance,
though it can request the U.S. Justice Department issue an injunction to shut
a facility. The agency also doesn't regulate auditors farms hire to certify
that their operations comply with good safety practices.

While the panel report makes no specific recommendations, "reforms in third
party audits are essential," committee Democrats wrote in a letter today to
the FDA. Auditors are hired by grocers, processors and others to ensure best
practices are used to ensure food is safe.

"Weakness in third-party auditors represent a significant gap in the food-
safety system because the auditors are often the only entities to inspect a
farm or facility," according to the letter, signed by Representative Henry
Waxman of California, the committee's senior Democrat, and three other
lawmakers.

'Superior' Rating

Jensen Farms was graded by an independent auditor as having "superior" safety
practices just one month before consumers became ill from eating the fruit.

Representatives of Jensen Farms didn't immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, is among grocers facing
lawsuits claiming they sold contaminated cantaloupe. Costco Wholesale Corp. is
developing new safety protocols as a result. The outbreak occurred in
September and October.

"It's unfortunate that victims and their families weren't involved in the
congressional committee's investigation," said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based
food safety lawyer who represents clients in the Jensen Farms case, in an
interview.

"There's really nothing new that's added," said Marler, referring to the
report. "It's basically what the FDA already found."

Widespread contamination and unsanitary practices were found at a packing
facility owned by the company, the FDA said in an Oct. 18 warning letter.

"FDA officials stated that the outbreak could likely have been prevented if
Jensen Farms had maintained its facilities in accordance with exiting FDA
guidance," according to the House panel's report.

The letter to the FDA calling for audit oversight was also signed by Diana
DeGette of Colorado, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations, Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and John
Dingell of Michigan.
