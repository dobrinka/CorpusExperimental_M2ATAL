Anti-ageing hope for Vitamin D

(UKPA) - 1 day ago

Vitamin D supplements may have wide-ranging anti-ageing properties including
the preservation of eyesight, research suggests.

Middle-aged mice treated with the vitamin for six weeks underwent changes in
their eyes that led to improved vision.

Levels of amyloid beta, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer's disease and
known to be a hallmark of ageing, were also reduced in the animals' eyes and
blood vessels.

Although the research is still at an early stage, scientists believe it could
have important implications for human health.

Boosting vitamin D intake may have broad anti-ageing effects and in particular
help prevent loss of vision and blindness in older people, it is claimed.

Lead scientist Professor Glen Jeffery, from the Institute of Ophthalmology at
University College London, said: "Finding that amyloid deposits were reduced
in the blood vessels of mice that had been given vitamin D supplements
suggests that vitamin D could be useful in helping to prevent a range of age-
related health problems, from deteriorating vision to heart disease."

Age-related inflammation and damage to the eye's retina can lead to macular
degeneration, the biggest cause of blindness in people over the age of 50 in
the developed world.

By the time a person is 70, the effects of normal ageing can lead to a 30%
reduction in the number of light receptive cells in the retina.

The research findings are published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging.
