The Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians warns the public against giving
children, with high fever, aspirin and similar non-steroid anti-inflammatory
drugs which induces bleeding in the case of dengue haemorrhagic fever.

  

Following is the text of the SLCP communique titled, "Important Message from
the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians":

  

"Presently, Paediatric wards in most parts of the country are dealing with
large numbers of children with Dengue Fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic fever.

  

"It is noted that some of these children have received medication for high
fever with non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen,
mefanamic acid and diclofenac sodium suppositories, prior to admission to
hospital. "It is now well documented that children who have had these
medicines have a greater potential to bleed when they have Dengue Haemorrhagic
Fever. This is causing major problems in treating them.

  

"The Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians wishes to inform all parents that it
is best to refrain from giving their children these medications in the
presence of fever. These medications are available in the market under
different trade names hence, it is important that you check the labels of all
medications available for control of fever prior to giving them to your child.

  

"It is advisable to use only paracetamol at the recommended dosage as a
medication, to bring down such fevers, in addition to tepid sponging."
