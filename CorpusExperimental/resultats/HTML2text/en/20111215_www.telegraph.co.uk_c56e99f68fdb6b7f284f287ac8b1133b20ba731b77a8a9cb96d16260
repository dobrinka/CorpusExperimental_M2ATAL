# Mr Right does not exist, poll finds

##  Three in four women believe there is no such thing as the perfect man,
with most seeing their partner as only 69 per cent perfect.

Common faults that mean men miss the mark included watching too much sport and
poor personal grooming.

Bathroom habits such as leaving the toilet door open were also cited by women
taking part in the survey as a frequent failing.

The poll of 2,000 women showed more than 75 per cent believed the perfect man
did not exist.

Other shortcomings were an inability to multi-task, criticising their
partner's driving and not getting along with her family.

Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington which commissioned the
research, said: "It seems that women are actually quite realistic on what they
look for from their partner.

"While they might happily overlook a few common flaws from their guys, there
are certain behaviours that men just won't get away with."

The results showed one in five women think their partner only pretends to
listen to them while leaving clothes on the bedroom floor and snoring were
among other gripes.

The perfect man would be expected to make an effort with his partner's
friends, avoid using her toothbrush, stay clean-shaven and not be lazy.

But above all, 35 per cent of women rate a good personality as most important
with sense of humour the top quality for a quarter of respondents.

Footballer David Beckham came top in the poll of perfect celebrity man, while
chef Gordon Ramsay ranked near the bottom.

Miss McReynolds added: "It's clear that while guys may not be completely
perfect, there are plenty of things they can be perfect in, in order to please
their partner.

"As long as guys take the time to look after themselves, be attentive and keep
up appearances then their partner will be willing to overlook the smaller pet
peeves.

"The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham,
and their partners don't expect them to - but there are still a number of
small changes they can do to make a big difference."
