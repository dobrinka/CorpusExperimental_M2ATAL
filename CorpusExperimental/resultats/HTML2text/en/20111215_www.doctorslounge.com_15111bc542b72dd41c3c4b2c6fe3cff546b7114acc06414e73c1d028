**School-based clinics can identify children with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis, and may be useful for diagnosing children with less severe symptoms, according to a study published online Dec. 12 in _BMJ Open_.**

THURSDAY, Dec. 15 (HealthDay News) -- School-based clinics can identify
children with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), and
may be useful for diagnosing children with less severe symptoms, according to
a study published online Dec. 12 in _BMJ Open_.

Esther M. Crawley, B.M., B.Ch., Ph.D., from the School of Social and Community
Medicine in Bristol, U.K., and colleagues examined the feasibility of
organizing clinics for CFS/ME in schools. A total of 2,855 children, aged 11
to 16 years, from three schools were enrolled. Over a six-week term, children
who missed ≥20 percent of school without a known cause were identified, and
those with fatigue were evaluated at a specialist CFS/ME service. Outcomes for
children identified as possibly having CFS/ME through school-based clinics
were compared to outcomes for children referred through health services.

The investigators found that a total of 461 children missed ≥20 percent of
school. For 315 children, the reason for absence was known, including three
with CFS/ME. Of the 146 children with unexplained absence, 112 attended the
school clinic; two children had previously been diagnosed with CFS/ME.
Specialist clinic referrals amounted to 42, of which 23 children were
diagnosed with CFS/ME. In total, 28 children (1.0 percent) had CFS/ME. The
children identified through the school-based clinic had been ill for a period
of time comparable to those referred through health services, but had less
fatigue and disability, and fewer symptoms. Six of the 19 children who were
followed recovered fully at six weeks, and another six recovered at six
months.

"Children diagnosed through school-based clinics are less severely affected
than those referred to specialist services and appear to make rapid progress
when they access treatment," the authors write.
