## addicted to the internet

# Can you really be addicted to the internet?

Chinese scientists have observed differences in the brains of people who
obsessively use the internet similar to those found in people who have
substance addictions. Is this proof that the internet can be addictive?

Several reports today suggest that a study of the brains of people who
excessively use the internet show abnormalities similar to those found in
people with substance addictions could be proof that the internet has similar
addictive qualities to drugs, alcohol or tobacco. The Independent's report
here is the most extensive. It says:

> Internet addiction has for the first time been linked with changes in the
brain similar to those seen in people addicted to alcohol, cocaine and
cannabis. In a groundbreaking study, researchers used MRI scanners to reveal
abnormalities in the brains of adolescents who spent many hours on the
internet, to the detriment of their social and personal lives. The finding
could throw light on other behavioural problems and lead to the development of
new approaches to treatment, researchers said. An estimated 5 to 10 per cent
of internet users are thought to be addicted – meaning they are unable to
control their use. The majority are games players who become so absorbed in
the activity they go without food or drink for long periods and their
education, work and relationships suffer.

**But is there really such a thing as internet addiction?**

## The claim

The reports are based on this study, conducted in China and published yeserday
in the online journal Public Library of Science One. The abstract says:

> **Background**

>

> Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is currently becoming a serious mental
health issue around the globe. Previous studies regarding IAD were mainly
focused on associated psychological examinations. However, there are few
studies on brain structure and function about IAD. In this study, we used
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity in
adolescents with IAD.

>

> **Methodology/Principal Findings**

>

> Seventeen IAD subjects and sixteen healthy controls without IAD participated
in this study. Whole brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA)
was performed by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to localize abnormal
white matter regions between groups. TBSS demonstrated that IAD had
significantly lower FA than controls throughout the brain, including the
orbito-frontal white matter, corpus callosum, cingulum, inferior fronto-
occipital fasciculus, and corona radiation, internal and external capsules,
while exhibiting no areas of higher FA. Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was
used to detect changes of diffusivity indices in the regions showing FA
abnormalities. In most VOIs, FA reductions were caused by an increase in
radial diffusivity while no changes in axial diffusivity. Correlation analysis
was performed to assess the relationship between FA and behavioral measures
within the IAD group. Significantly negative correlations were found between
FA values in the left genu of the corpus callosum and the Screen for Child
Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and between FA values in the left
external capsule and the Young's Internet addiction scale.

>

> **Conclusions**

>

> Our findings suggest that IAD demonstrated widespread reductions of FA in
major white matter pathways and such abnormal white matter structure may be
linked to some behavioral impairments. In addition, white matter integrity may
serve as a potential new treatment target and FA may be as a qualified
biomarker to understand the underlying neural mechanisms of injury or to
assess the effectiveness of specific early interventions in IAD.

  
I'm going to look into whether internet addiction is considered a medical
condition. I'm also curious about the source of claims that 5-10% of internet
users are addicted and unable to control their use and report back. I also
wonder whether internet addiction is always a bad thing? Do you have an
evidence or experience that might help? Get in touch below the line, email me

## Analysis

The Royal College of Psychiatrists told me that psychiatrists in the UK refer
to two international sources to define whether a set of symptoms is a
diagnosable illness or not. The World Health Organisation publishes
International Classification of Diseases periodically, but the last came into
use in 1994 and therefore inevitably includes no reference to the internet.

The other source is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is due to be updated next year.
The committees responsible for formulating this policy has been debating
whether to include internet addiction in its section on addictions. The
current proposals reclassify internet gambling as an addiction rather than a
compulsive behaviour but don't include internet addiction in its own right.
This is still open to consultation, fiercely contested and subject to new
evidence, including potentially the Chinese study.

Last year Charles O'Brien of the University of Pennsylvania, the chair of the
addictions committee, said in a press conference reported here, that internet
addiction would not be included but that they would recommend future research
in the area. The report said:

>  
He [O'Brien] said his work group had considered including sex and Internet
addictions as disorders, but decided there was insufficient evidence to allow
development of reliable diagnostic criteria for them. Consequently, gambling
addiction is slated to be the only disorder formally listed in the behavioral
addictions category.

>

> But O'Brien added that, under current plans, sex and Internet addictions
would be included in an appendix to DSM-V, intended to encourage additional
research that could lead to their inclusion in future editions.

The first and obvious point to make about the Chinese study is that it's very
small and therefore not conclusive of anything. The second was made by Colin
Drummond, professor of addiction psychiatry at Kings College London, which has
the largest research centre for psychiatry in Europe, on the Today programme
this morning. You can listen to him here and he's just expanded his argument
in a phone interview with me. I asked him whether internet addiction is a
medical illness. He said:

> No. It's interesting that people who use the internet excessively seem to
have different brain structures compared with people who don't but the big
issue is whether we are looking at cause or effect. There is quite good
evidence that people who engage in substance misuse and addictions and to some
extent gambling do have problems with impulse control which fits with
abnormalities in the frontal lobes of the brain similar to those in this
study. But it is a big leap to go from there to suggest that the internet is
re-wiring your brain.

>

> If people have emotional problems and that leads them to use the internet
obsessively then they obviously need help to deal with those problems, but
that's quite different to saying that the internet is addictive. Perhaps
unhappy people or people with impulse control problems may well need some
help. I'm not denying it' a problem for individuals, but trying to classify it
as an addiction has risks attached to it. They are treating an addiction
rather than emotional problems that might lead to the emotional behaviour.
Excessively internet use is a symptom not a cause of a person's problems.

>

> Are people drawn to the internet because they have impulse control issues?
Probably, that's part of the problem they have. The suggestion form this paper
is that it's working the other way round; that it's changing people's brain
functioning. The implication people who disapprove of the internet can make is
that it's potentially addictive and a bad thing that could harm our youth. In
China there has been a considerable problem with the publicity that internet
addiction has got. In the 1990s there was one doctor giving teenagers
electroshock treatment to try and cure addiction to the internet. There are
other examples of programmes set up that use physical punishment to try and
stop people from excessive internet use. That's one of the side effects of
medicalising and trying to turn this into a disorder instead of seeing it as a
type of behaviour.

>

> Gambling addiction or drug addiction is somewhat different from spending a
lot of time on social network sites or playing warcraft. It's a problem if you
are surfing Facebook instead of doing your A-levels, but it's a different
order to losing all your money from gambling or getting liver disease from
drinking. We should be much more concerned about alcohol and tobacco addiction
which is killing millions around the world.

Drummond is explaining the brain patterns found in the Chinese study as being
similar ones found in people who have impulse control problems – but that
doesn't mean that the internet is the cause but instead it could be the
symptom. He didn't deny that excessive internet use can be a problem for
individuals but he argues that it trivialises "real" addictions if other
behaviour is included and can warp treatment programmes. If problematic over-
use of the internet is a symptom of other emotional problems, there's no point
treating the symptom.

But others within the psychiatric community do believe it's a real disorder.
The Independent's story reports:

> Henrietta Bowden Jones, consultant psychiatrist at Imperial College, London,
who runs Britain's only NHS clinic for internet addicts and problem gamblers,
said: "The majority of people we see with serious internet addiction are
gamers – people who spend long hours in roles in various games that cause them
to disregard their obligations. I have seen people who stopped attending
university lectures, failed their degrees or their marriages broke down
because they were unable to emotionally connect with anything outside the
game."

>

> Although most of the population was spending longer online, that was not
evidence of addiction, she said. "It is different. We are doing it because
modern life requires us to link up over the net in regard to jobs,
professional and social connections – but not in an obsessive way. When
someone comes to you and says they did not sleep last night because they spent
14 hours playing games, and it was the same the previous night, and they tried
to stop but they couldn't – you know they have a problem. It does tend to be
the gaming that catches people out."

## Summary

Lives can suffer profoundly as a result of overusing the internet whether they
are gambling, obsessively using social media sites or playing online games.
But whether this means they are addicted to the internet or not is fiercely
contested by psychiatrists. Some argue that there is a growing body of
evidence such as the Chinese study published this week which suggests that
there is a physical effect of internet addiction. But that study was too small
to draw conclusions from. It also did not establish whether the brain patterns
found in compulsive internet users were a cause or symptom of their behaviour.
Others say that regardless, the impact is serious enough for it to require
classification.

The counter argument is that in fact problem compulsive use of the internet is
a symptom of other conditions. Studies show that many people who cannot
control their internet use have other psychiatric disorders as well. If it's
taken as a disorder in its own right not only will the true cause of the
problem not be identified and treated, but it could also distract focus from
"real" substance addictions or mental illnesses.

The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders has rejected classifying internet addiction as a disorder in
its forthcoming revised guidance that heavily influences diagnosis and
treatment in the UK. But it has indicated that further research is needed to
settle the debate once and for all. **The jury is still out. **

12.30pm:

## Confessions of a self confessed addict

Jonathan Haynes, web news editor at the Guardian, has written the below few
paragraphs for us about his obsession with the internet. It's anecdote, rather
than evidence, but I think it raises a neat point about whether compulsive use
of the internet is always harmful - it's been quite instructive in Jonathan's
career. Evidence of his compulsive use can be seen on his twitter home page,
here. Jonathan writes:

> ![Jonathan Haynes](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-
images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/8/14/1250280412331/wr.jpeg)

>

> Addiction to the internet itself seems unlikely, however addiction to
accessing information on it, well I'd love to try to argue against that but I
cannot. When you find yourself with five columns of Twitter on Tweetdeck on a
big screen right in front of you - but your hand still inexplicably reaching
for your iPhone to check if what's on Twitter there is even newer … you know
there's a problem.

>

> When you've disabled your email accounts because you're on holiday - and yet
you still find your phone in your hand and your fingers having moved without
you even noticing in search of latest messages … you know it's really not
healthy.

>

> When your router breaks and your housemate suggests calling an engineer and
living without the internet for a few days and you literally run to the shop
to buy a new one because you can't bare the thought of even an evening with
connection to the net …

>

> When the last thing you do before you sleep is tweet and the first thing
when you wake up, and sometimes when you even wake up in the middle of the
night and tweet then too. The internet may not be addictive itself, but it
sure helps!

Below the line there are a couple of points related to this. @mattmags makes
thids reference:

> According to Professor Bruce Hood's latest book, it's not the Internet that
you get addicted to, but email and social networking sites like Facebook and
Twitter. It's the little hit of that you get when someone likes your post, or
retweets or otherwise demonstrates approval of your input that is addictive.
It's also the fact that it doesn't happen automatically, but only
occassionaly, that is the real hook. Like a one-armed bandit, you only get the
payback sporadically, and it's that that keeps you coming back for more.

Jonathan says he's hooked on the information the internet brings, Prof Hood
writes about addiction to networking sites and @epinoa makes this point:

> If it triggers a dopamine response then you can become addicted to it. Not a
difficult assessment.

If it does trigger a dopamine response is that coming from the internet or
what the person is finding there? Are people addicted to the internet, or to
social networks, information, gaming, shopping or pornography?

2.48pm:

## Prevalence

I've just been speaking with Mark Griffiths from Nottingham Trent University
who has been researching online addiction since 1994. I asked him specifically
about the prevalence issue. He thinks that the estimations of 5-10% are wildly
excessive. However, he does believe that a very small number of people are
addicted to the internet in its own right but that that number is over-
inflated by others who compulsively use the internet as a symptom of another
psychological disorder or people who are addicted to doing things that the
internet facilitates like gaming or pornography. He said:

> The 5-10% figure comes from a conglomeration of studies. I've been really
highly critical of prevalence surveys. None of the instruments that are used
assess any kind of severity. They are yes or no questions. For addictive
behaviour to be classed as addictive it should have a negative detrimental
effect. Those scales measure preoccupation rather than addiction. You can have
obsessive gamers or internet users with no detrimental effects.

>

> In all my work on behavioural addictions I define it in terms of six
components: salience – it is the single most important things in their lives;
mood modification – they use it to get excited or numb themselves; tolerance –
they need more of the activity to satisfy cravings; withdrawal – I would
expect any genuine addict to experience psychological moodiness and
irritability if they stopped and also physiological symptoms such as nausea,
shakiness or anxiety attacks; conflict within themselves and with others and a
subjective loss of control; and relapse - if you have managed to give up if
you engage again you go straight back into old habits. When I've applied that
case studies I've come across very, very few fulfil all six of those
components.

>

> Alcoholism affects between 1-2% of the adult population. If it really did
affect it we would have a treatment centre in every major city. That just
hasn't happened. We know people seek treatment and they may be addicted to
something they find on the internet. But when we investigate we end up with
only a handful of people addicted to the internet in the way others are
addicted to alcohol.

Perhaps it's that people who have certain things going on in their brain
(chemically) are more prone to certain kinds of behaviour, particularly those
that block out less pleasant aspects of life. An 'addictive personality', if
you like (much as it has become some kind of buzz-phrase). This could include
drug or alcohol use but also things like online gambling or just using the
internet excessively in general, at the milder (less physically harmful) end
of the spectrum.

I've written on similar matters in academic journals, but the reference to
biological change as relevant to showing addiction is an oft-repeated fallacy.
Our mind IS our brain and vice versa. EVERYTHING we do psychologically, from
walking the dog, to standing up, to deciding to skip rope, causes physical
changes in the brain. After all, the brain is the physical manifestation of
the mind, so where WOULD you expect your thoughts to be physically manifested
- in the spleen?

All thoughts arise from the brain, hence all thoughts involve change to brain
chemistry. Hence the mere fact that something involves a change to brain
chemistry tells us absolutely nothing about whether it is an
illness/addiction/etc. You can detect brain changes for a whole variety of
every-day normal activities, simply because the brain is the physical
manifestation of the mind. Do something with your mind, and there will be a
corresponding change in the brain.

Unless someone comes up with evidence that our psychological processes are
manifested somewhere OTHER than the brain, can we all please stop acting like
changes to brain chemistry are somehow informative?

(if you have university access to periodicals, look up Edwards 'Ethical
decisions in the classification of mental processes as mental illness' in
Philosophy, Psychology and Psychiatry, and then my reply to Wakefield (forgot
the title - something like 'Changing functions' - at the end of the same
volume. I apologise for the article being written so badly - it was my first
publication, and my writing was embarassingly obtuse, but the ideas still hold
up.)

Further to the above - my apologies for referring you to material locked off
behind journal paywalls. I'm pretty new to academia (only 5 publications) so
it would be a bit arrogant to start up my own website just yet. Without that,
the only way to access academic articles is to use university computers or
logons (for which the education system pays extortionate amounts of money -
despite the academics providing the content for free, reviewing the content
for free and advising unsuccessful submitters for free...and then the uni has
to pay to access it's own academics' work!). Awful system, but not one I can
do anything about.

Incidentally (and I should have stated this in my first post)....PERMANENT
change to brain chemistry is a different matter. My criticism is that simply
saying 'x causes a change to brain activity' doesn't tell us whether it's a
permanent change (and even then, the relationship can be complex), or the kind
of normal change we constantly undergo.

to the internet.

To me, being addicted to something means you're dependent on it to

Of course the internet is addictive. Anything that delivers to the human brain
and senses such a huge ammount of stimuli is bound to be addictive.

This is not altogether a negative thing however. I think that spending "some"
time on the internet could be very helpful for those who suffer from
psychriatric disorders. Internet use maybe even be used eventually in some
patients treatment plans. Not just as stimuli but also as an information tool;
informing patients about their conditions whilst their stimuli is raised....

To me that seems almost obvious.

Re: mattmags, I can believe that, given the way that they repeatedly utilise
psychological hooks to draw you back into usage. It reminds me of the way that
automatic gambling machines use bells, whistles, and 'special plays' to keep
you returning for 'one more round'.

Most non-drug addiction (as far as I understand, and I have absolutely no
expertise on the issue) seems to work on the basis of a series of irregular
low-payout 'hits' that trigger the brain's reward mechanisms without actually
costing the proprietor a great deal (e.g. a series of low-money payouts, or
meaningless but psychologically effective Farmville wins, or friendship
offers, approving comments, etc). Some internet sites manage to utilise the
same method as gambling machines, without having to even make the 'hit'
financial.

The sporadic nature also discourages any rational cost-benefit analysis (e.g.
recognition that gambling machines are pre-programmed to pay less than they
take).

I'm not sure that Facebook is the worst offender. Pornography, combined with
the internet, seems like a recipe for huge addiction issues, and it doesn't
surprise me that porn-addiction-therapy is a growing industry for both sexes.

The internet is the delivery method, not an end in itself.

As the internet is merely the method, the supply method, surely the article
should be about possibly being addicted to "content delivered via the

@epinoa @patrician

Not exactly. Lots of things trigger a dopamine response - receiving a text
produces a dopamine response. Not sure we could only look for that. Surely if
someone derives pleasure from an activity it is producing a dopamine response.

That does mean that basically everything is addictive but you have to draw the
line somewhere. It would be interesting if people obsessed with the internet
produced more dopamine in response to it - but then again, maybe all that
tells us is that they're enjoying it more than most?

And perhaps the reason they are enjoying more than most is a psychological one
like a chance to escape to a fantasy world or the ability to be anonymous (and
say what you want etc).

In that case is it an addiction or an obsession? If it's an obsession due to
escapism, is it a separate disorder or a symptom of something like depression?

Nicotine addiction is slightly different as it is a neurotransmitter and
crosses the blood brain barrier. As such your brain chemistry is directly
affected.

Any dopamine release due to a release from using the internet would be purely
psychological. Errr unless the light/em produced by the monitor elicits a
response.

Response ot Epinoa - you (yes - you personally!) get a constant stream of
dopamine responses in your brain to all sort sof things that you do. Its part
of your biochemistry, and you'd probably die without it. Everyone responds to
such simple, normal things as smiling, laughing, eating, excercise, sex etc -
how do you discriminate whats a healthy and normal response, from one that
isn't?

Create an unequal society in the physical real world ie don’t include everyone

When I was in my early 20s and teenage years, I was so heavily dependant on
the internet, be it playing online games (Ragnarok Online was my drug), or
just general browsing, it helped me forget my dire working class upbringing
and entering the 'Real' world. Whenever I wasn't on it, I had the exact
thoughts and worries always bubbling, its kinda whats associated with most
drug users, it helps you forget worries, honestly I used to feel like I was in
withdrawal whenever I was away from it longer than a day...

Its easy to say, 'oh but all kids play games on the computer at that age' or
'so what its not dangerous', its exactly what I would say to my old friends
and family.

Thinking about it now, the dependance was frightening, my social life was down
the pan not to mention my academic life because the internet made me feel
brilliant. From my own experience, having a top level character on an online
game or having a huge forum post count (someone mentioned the same further up,
well kinda the same about people reacting to your facebook and twitter
updates), gave me such an adrenaline rush and confidence boost that the real
world could not offer.

Ironically, now I am not so heavily addicted to the internet, I still consider
beating an online game boss that took 20 mins with teamwork (think WoW,
Ragnarok) more fulfilling than getting a document approved at work.

We can live so much of our lives online, from paying bills and shopping
through to work and leisure activities, it can be difficult to tell an
'addict' from someone just going about their business. The person who is
always sat in front of their computer or always has a smartphone in hand might
look like an addict in the widely accepted sense but it is what they do when
the internet in unavailable that counts.

Surely anything that makes an individual feel "worthwhile" and "happy", could
be considered "addictive" in a psychological sense. Such behaviour could
include, watching football, shopping, Eastenders or Corrie.

However, in a physiological sense, addictive substances when withdrawn have
very physical manifestation, such as extreme emotional responses, cold sweats,
shakes, perhaps even heart attacks and death.

Hardly something the internet could cause.

For example. Heroin is addictive, and if withdrawn will cause the addict
problems. Cannabis is not, but it is enjoyable for users and is habit forming.  
It may make the individual less happy if withdrawn.

The word addictive is an overused and misunderstood term, and is often used in
a derogitory manner to discourage certain behaviour which makes people happy.

The fact that this research comes from a country, seemingly hell bent on
restricting internet access, freedom of expression, and general happiness
should not be ignored.

**Perhaps some are "addicted" to controlling populations...?**

It's not addictive ... it is habit forming. You will not break into a
neighbours house out of desperation to read the Guardian website.

your iPhone to check if what's on Twitter there is even newer … you know
there's a problem.

Yep.

Gaps in recording and invoicing for patient treatments result in trusts losing
