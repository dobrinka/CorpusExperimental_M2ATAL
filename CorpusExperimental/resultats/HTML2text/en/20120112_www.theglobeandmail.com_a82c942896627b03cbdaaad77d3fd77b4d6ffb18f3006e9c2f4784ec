##  In Jerusalem, women are voiceless at a decidedly womanly event

The controversial exclusion of women from various settings in Israel because
of pressure from ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders reached a new level this week
with a major conference on gynecological advances that is permitting only
males to address the audience.

The conference on "Innovations in Gynecology/Obstetrics and Halacha [Jewish
law]" is being held by the Puah Institute this Wednesday in Jerusalem. It will
include such topics as "ovary implants," "how to choose a suitable
contraceptive pill" and "intimacy during rocket attacks," in which there are
many qualified female professionals, but none will be permitted to speak, at
least not from the podium.

  * Israeli-Palestinian talks end without breakthrough

Women are allowed in the audience, in a section separate from men.

Several Israeli human rights groups have protested the men-only nature of the
conference. While it is considered a private rather than a public forum, and
therefore not subject to Israeli policies against discrimination, Puah
receives considerable funding from the Health Ministry, these complainants
point out.

Such complaints are unlikely to make much of an impression, however. The
Health Minister, to whom they are addressed, is actually the Prime Minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, owing to another sop to the Ultra-Orthodox.

The United Torah Judaism party refused to formally join the coalition cabinet
since doing so would signal an acceptance of the Zionist state, something its
beliefs preclude. So its representative was given the post of Deputy Health
Minister, a non-cabinet position. It is this ultra-Orthodox man who really
runs the department, while the PM represents it at the cabinet table.

At least two male Israeli doctors have withdrawn from making presentations at
this week's Puah event once they were made aware of the exclusion of women, or
at least once public outrage over the exclusion became apparent.

Puah - ironically named for one of the ancient Hebrew midwives believed to
have refused the pharaoh's order to kill all male babies in Egypt at the time
of Moses - has held many other conferences with male-only speakers. But this
one comes on the heels of several other incidents in which women, or their
images, have been excluded from public places under pressure from ultra-
Orthodox leaders and their enforcement squads.

Until two years ago, public buses did not run through such religious
neighbourhoods as Mea Sharim, in Jerusalem, and Beit Shemesh outside the city,
because of frequent attacks on the buses in which windows were smashed by
rocks.

Having been ordered to resume service in all these communities, many buses
carry security guards and most adhere to the practice demanded by the
rabbinate of seating women only at the back of the bus. Recent attempts to
break this practice have resulted in well-reported altercations with male
passengers.

As well, pictures of women are not displayed in the posters and ads carried by
the bus in these areas, nor are they shown in ads at bus stops in religious
communities.

As far as Puah is concerned, it operates on a strictly kosher basis, as
required by the ultra-Orthodox rabbinate. While there are women on its board
of directors, its public face is strictly male, and the two sexes are not
allowed to mix at its events.

To be sure, not all sectors of the ultra-Orthodox community support these
exclusionary tactics, explains Nachman Ben-Yehuda, a Hebrew University
sociology professor and author of the recently published book Theocratic
Democracy. "But most people are too afraid to speak out."
