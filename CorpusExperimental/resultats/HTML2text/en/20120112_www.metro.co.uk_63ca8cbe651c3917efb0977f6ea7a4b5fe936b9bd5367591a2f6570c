# Boring office environments make workers hit the booze

## A boring office environment is likely to see staff reaching for the booze,
new research has found.

/11/article-1326310741779-00111B4D00000190-245313_466x310.jpg) Bored staff are
heading for the booze (Picture: Stock)

Work drudgery was well documented in The Office but chronic boredom could have
you reaching for the chocolate bar - or even the bottle.  

Office tedium is a worry for a quarter of staff who comfort eat at work and
booze afterwards.  

Half of the 102 workers in a study by the University of Central Lancashire
made mistakes out of boredom.

'Managers might consider using boredom proneness as a tool when selecting
staff,' said researcher Dr Sandi Mann.  

'My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an
undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of
workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping.

'This could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling
and empowerment. Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could
include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens.'
