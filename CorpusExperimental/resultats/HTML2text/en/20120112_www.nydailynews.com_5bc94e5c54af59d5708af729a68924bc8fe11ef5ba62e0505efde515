An allergic Virginia first-grader died after a classmate gave her a peanut,
police concluded after an investigation.

The tragic case has rekindled questions about how prepared schools are to
handle students with severe allergies, ABC News reported Wednesday.

Ammaria Johnson, 7, was on the playground of her Chesterfield County
elementary school when she ate the nut on Jan. 3 and quickly complained of
breathing trouble and hives. By the time emergency crews arrived, Ammaria was
in cardiac arrest. She died a short time later at a local hospital.

Her mother, Laura Pendleton, told WTVR-TV that she couldn't understand what
had gone so wrong.

"She has an allergy action plan at the school," said Pendleton, who told the
TV station she authorized the school to give her child Benadryl during an
allergic reaction. "They didn't do that."

**FOOD ALLERGY SYMPTOMS**

She added that she had tried to provide the school with an EpiPen, a single-
dose emergency injection tool, but had been told to keep it at home.

Police told ABC News the investigation found no criminal wrongdoing.

"Although not a crime, Ammaria's death is a tragedy and the Chesterfield
County Police Department expresses its deepest sympathies to her family,
classmates and school personnel as they deal with this difficult and painful
event," police chief Col. Thierry Dupuis told ABC in a statement.

The case has been especially alarming to parents and doctors who have seen
peanut allergies in children triple over the past 10 years with two in every
100 children reportedly affected.

One doctor told ABC News that he believed stocking EpiPens in schools may be a
good idea to prevent future tragedies.

"There are kids who don't know they're food allergic until they get into the
food," Dr. Dan Atkins told ABC. "In that situation, it would be good to have
an EpiPen available."

in Utah, a state well-known for Mormon communities. Which other celebs belong
