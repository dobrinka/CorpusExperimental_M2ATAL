The Associated Press

Date: Tuesday Jan. 17, 2012 9:34 AM ET

Celebrity chef and Food Network star Paula Deen is teaming with drugmaker Novo
Nordisk to launch a program that aims to help people live with Type 2 diabetes
and promote a Novo diabetes drug.

The program is called Diabetes in a New Light and offers tips on food
preparation, stress management and working with doctors on a treatment plan.
Recipes and tips can be found at www.Diabetesinanewlight.com .

Deen has Type 2 diabetes and takes Victoza, a once-daily noninsulin injection.
The website links to promotional materials for the drug.

Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. In Type 2 diabetes, the body
either does not produce enough insulin or does not use it efficiently,
allowing excess sugar, or glucose, to accumulate in the blood.

Technology was supposed to make man smarter; we've become antisocial, lazy and
perhaps even less intelligent. Put down the blackberries/iphones and talk to
your neighbour, be it across the table or street.
