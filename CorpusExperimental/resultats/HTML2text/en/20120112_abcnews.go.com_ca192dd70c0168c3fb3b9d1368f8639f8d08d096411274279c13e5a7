# Homicide Drops off US List of Top Causes of Death

By MIKE STOBBE AP Medical Writer

ATLANTA January 11, 2012 (AP)

For the first time in almost half a century, homicide has fallen off the list
of the nation's top 15 causes of death, bumped by a lung illness that often
develops in elderly people who have choked on their food.

The 2010 list, released by the government Wednesday, reflects at least two
major trends: Murders are down, and deaths from certain diseases are on the
rise as the population ages, health authorities said.

Homicide was overtaken at No. 15 by pneumonitis, seen mainly in people 75 and
older. It happens when food or vomit goes down the windpipe and causes deadly
damage to the lungs.

This is the first time since 1965 that homicide failed to make the list,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC's latest annual report on deaths contained several nuggets of good
news:

—The infant mortality rate dropped to an all-time low of 6.14 deaths per 1,000
births in 2010. It was 6.39 the year before.

—U.S. life expectancy for a child born in 2010 was about 78 years and 8
months, up about a little more than one month from life expectancy for 2009.

—Heart disease and cancer remain the top killers, accounting for nearly half
the nation's more than 2.4 million deaths in 2010. But the death rates from
them continued to decline.

— Death rates for five other leading causes of death also dropped in 2010,
including stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, flu/pneumonia
and blood infections.

But death rates increased for Alzheimer's disease, which is the nation's
sixth-leading killer, kidney disease (No. 8), chronic liver disease and
cirrhosis (No. 12), Parkinson's disease (No. 14) and pneumonitis.

The report is drawn from a review of at least 98 percent of the death
certificates filed in the U.S. in 2010.

The government has been keeping a list of the top causes of death since 1949.
Homicide has historically ranked fairly low. It was as high as 10th in 1989
and in 1991 through 1993, when the nation saw a surge in youth homicides
related to the crack epidemic.

In the past decade, homicide's highest ranking was 13th. That was in 2001 and
was due in part to the 9/11 attacks.

Murders have been declining nationally since 2006, according to FBI
statistics. Falling homicide rates have been celebrated in several major
cities, including New York City, Detroit and Washington.

Criminologists have debated the reasons but believe several factors may be at
work. Among them: Abusive relationships don't end in murder as often as they
once did, thanks to increased incarcerations and better, earlier support for
victims.

"We've taken the home out of homicide," said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern
University criminologist who studies murder data.

Some also credit better police work and public health programs aimed at
reducing violence.

Demographics are an important factor, too, as the largest segment of the
population is now 50 and older. Younger people — who are most likely to commit
or fall victim to murder — are making up a smaller share of the population.

That ties in to the changes in the CDC's list of causes of death.

"The risk of homicide declines with age, and the risk of death by disease
increases," Fox said.

However, some causes of death associated with old age are giving way to
others, noted Robert Anderson, the CDC official who oversaw the report.
Doctors have been getting better at preventing and treating heart disease and
cancer, which allows something else to become the cause of death.

"In previous years, someone with both heart disease and Parkinson's would have
been more likely to have died from heart disease. Now with better treatment,
they die from Parkinson's instead," Anderson said in an email.

Pneumonitis is another example. Despite its name, pneumonitis is not related
to pneumonia. It occurs in people who have lost the ability to swallow or
protect their airway.
