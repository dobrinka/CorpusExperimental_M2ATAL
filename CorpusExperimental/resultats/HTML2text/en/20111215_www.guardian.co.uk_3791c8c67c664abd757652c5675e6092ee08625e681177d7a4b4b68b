trusts after committee found there were issues of 'capacity and capability of
leadership'. Photograph: Jonathan Hordle / Rex Features

Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, has ordered "independent assessments" of
the boards of NHS trusts after a powerful parliamentary committee found that
half of them had issues of "capacity and capability of leadership", preventing
them meeting the government's deadline to become foundation hospitals by 2014.

Lansley will announce the new inspection regime, to be run by external
consultants, as part of framework of change in the NHS to drive up standards.
He has been dismayed by the findings of the public accounts committee who
bluntly state the scale of the challenge ahead.

The committee said it will be a "very tall order to get" NHS trusts to become
foundation hospitals, which are free from Whitehall control. The committe warn
that four out of five of the 113 remaining trusts "face financial
difficulties. Most face strategic challenges, performance issues and
governance problems".

Of these, 20 hospitals have declared that they will never make foundation
status in their present circumstances – and half of these are in London. The
MPs warn that while the department has said there are no current plans to
close hospitals, "it is difficult to see why other organisations would want to
take them on".

"The chief executive of the NHS is only "moderately confident" that London's
hospital system can be turned round, and acknowledged the unique challenges
and obstacles to be overcome," said Margaret Hodge, chair of the committee.

She added that: "These trusts will be forced into reconfigurations or even
mergers. This may deal with the financial challenges involved but could leave
some deprived communities with unequal access to high quality healthcare, when
hospital departments are closed and services moved."

The issues surrounding financing have also seen senior doctors resign in
disgust at the cuts. Yesterday it emerged that Guy Broome, an orthopaedic
surgeon who chaired the medical staff committee at debt-ridden North Cumbria
University Hospitals NHS Trust, told Pulse that he had resigned because
patients were being denied care on financial rather than clinical grounds. He
also claimed the hospital had attempted to gag him from publicly voicing his
fears about patient safety.

The trust denies both charges. It is currently attempting to save £15m but
said all decisions on care were "clinically assessed".

Hodge said that the capital was of particular concern. "London is in a
particularly shocking state and nobody has got a grip on long-standing
problems. We remain to be convinced that combining struggling hospitals into
larger trusts – as with South London – will somehow produce viable
organisations offering good quality, accessible healthcare.

The health secretary had already threatened to managers that they would be
"removed and replaced" if they failed to get hospitals ready to become
foundation trusts by 2014. Lansley has been extremely concerned that the
deadline of 2014 to get trusts "up to scratch" will be missed –throwing into
doubt whether his market reforms would work if hospitals were not free to
compete for patients on a level playing field without the state, in the form
of the department of health, intervening.

He points out that the committee found that "two thirds (of NHS trusts)
acknowledge they have performance and quality challenges and nearly 40% say
they need to strengthen their governance and their leadership".

Lansley says the roots of the current problem lie with Labour's record –
especially of letting PFI costs escalate. "Today's report by the Public
Accounts Committee confirms that Labour left some parts of the NHS with a
dismal legacy of PFI bills, hidden bailouts, and in some cases inadequate
leadership to face these challenges and those of the future. They swept these
problems under the carpet for a decade.

"While there are plenty of top performing trust boards, we are determined to
root out poor performance by shining a light into every area of the service.
This includes independent assessments to help the NHS identify where things
are going wrong so they can fix them."

Chris Ham of the health thinktank the King's Fund said the financial problems
were so large that there needed to be a "honest dialogue with the public and a
wider programme to reorganise the hospital sector, including service closures
where this is necessary to improve the quality of care".
