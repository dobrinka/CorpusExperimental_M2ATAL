Throat spray to help detect cancer

(UKPA) - 1 day ago

A fluorescent "throat spray" that pinpoints abnormal cells could help doctors
spot early oesophagus cancer, research has shown.

The disease, which killed Inspector Morse star John Thaw, can easily be missed
or wrongly diagnosed in its early stages. Often patients are given unnecessary
invasive treatment, including removal of the oesophagus - the "food pipe" that
connects the throat to the stomach.

The new technique involves spraying a fluorescent dye into the oesophagus that
attaches to normal, healthy cells. The dye cannot stick to cancer cells or
those turning malignant.

Abnormal cells stand out from healthy cells that glow green under light of a
specific wave length, so they can then be seen with an endoscope - a flexible
optical device - passed down the oesophagus.

Affected areas can be treated with radiofrequency ablation, a minimally
invasive method of killing cancer cells using electrical current.

Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald, from the Medical Research Council Cancer Cell Unit in
Cambridge, who led the study published in the journal Nature Medicine, said:
"Current methods to screen for oesophageal cancer are controversial - they are
costly, uncomfortable for the patient and are not completely accurate.

"Our technique highlights the exact position of a developing oesophageal
cancer, and how advanced it is, giving a more accurate picture. This could
spare patients radical surgery to remove the oesophagus that can result in
having to eat much smaller more regular meals and worse acid-reflux."

After pilot studies on large numbers of tissue samples, the spray was tested
on four patients in the process of having early cancer removed. In two cases,
the spray revealed hidden pre-cancerous areas that had evaded detection by
conventional imaging. Another patient whose entire oesophagus had been removed
was shown to have undergone unnecessary treatment. The cancer only affected a
small area and could have been treated less drastically.

Co-author Professor Kevin Brindle, from Cancer Research UK's Cambridge
Research Institute, said: "The benefit of using this dye is that it is
specific, relatively cheap and is found in our normal diets so unlikely to
cause any unwanted effects at the levels we use. We now need to test our
technique in newly diagnosed patients, but it has great potential to be used
with current imaging techniques to help improve treatment for oesophageal
cancer."

Oesophageal cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the UK. Each year around
8,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer and rates of the
disease in men have risen by more half in a generation. Risk factors for the
disease include alcohol use and smoking.
