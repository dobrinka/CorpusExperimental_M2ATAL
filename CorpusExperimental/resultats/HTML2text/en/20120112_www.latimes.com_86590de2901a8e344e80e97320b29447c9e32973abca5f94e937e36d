Homicide was not one of the nation's top 15 causes of death in 2010, according
to new government statistics. That's the first time since 1965 that homicide
has not ranked as a major killer of American citizens.  
  
The top 15 list, released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, analyzes data from death certificates. The report is preliminary;
a more detailed analysis will be released later.  
  
The death rate fell the most from 2009 to 2010 for non-Latino black males with
a nearly 2% decline in deaths. The death rate for non-Latino black females
decreased 1.5%.  
  
The preliminary homicide rate for 2010 was 5.2 deaths per 100,000 people.  
  
Overall, life expectancy inched upward, from 78.6 in 2009 to 78.7 in 2010.
Heart disease and cancer still account for about half of all deaths. HIV death
rates fell 13.3% from 2009 to 2010. But the disease "remains a public health
concern, especially for those between the ages of 15-64," the authors wrote.  
  
The leading causes of death are:  
  
Heart disease  
Cancer  
Lower respiratory diseases  
Stroke and related cerebrovascular diseases  
Accidents (unintentional injuries)  
Alzheimer's disease  
Diabetes  
Kidney diseases  
Influenza and pneumonia  
Suicide  
Septicemia  
Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis  
Hypertension and related renal disease  
Parkinson's disease  
Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids.  
  
Number 15 on the list -- pneumonitis -- refers to inflammation of the lungs
caused by medications or other exposures, such as breathing something harmful
over time. Death rates increased in 2010 for five conditions: Alzheimer's,
kidney disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, Parkinson's and
pneumonitis.  
  
The infant mortality dropped 3.9% from 2009 to 2010.

To aaaaaa5: I wonder what the list would look like if people ate responsibly,
did not smoke, exercised regularly, and made sure their children followed that
regimen.

This is good news?  How could we allow homicide to be even in the top 100
causes for death in America.  How is it that the most dangerous animal in the
forest are our fellow human beings?  One other major cause of death and
permanent disability is automobile crashes.  More than 40,000 Americans die
every year on the highways.  If we were to reduce the maximum speed to 30
miles per hour that would reduce deaths significantly and reduce our use of
fuel significantly.  However, we are in such a hurry that we are willing to
sacrifice the lives of tens of thousands of our neighbors, friends, and
relatives just so we can travel fast.  One hundred fifty years ago if we were
able to travel thirty miles in one day, we were happy.  Now, we have to be
able to move at 60 miles plus per hour to feel good.  I consider every highway
death that occurs at speeds above 30 miles per hour to be a form of murder.  I
live in Orange County about 90 miles from downtown San Diego and about 45
miles from downtown Los Angeles.  At thirty miles per hour I should be able to
get to Los Angeles in 90 miles and San Diego in three hours, oops that is
about how long it takes me in normal conditions  If we really want to save
lives all we have to do is change our expectations about what is normal.
Let's slow down and save lives.  Are you with me?

I wonder what this list would look like if we  had universal health coverage.
