![NHS Finding Hard to Deal with Neurology Issue
](http://visitbulgaria.info/images/imagecache/teaser_article/neurology.jpg)

The NHS is already going through a very bad phase, and it seems like its
troubles are not going to end anytime soon as the new stats released by
Parkinson's UK have clearly depicted that there will be in excess of 28%
increase in the cases confirmed positive for the highly dangerous Parkinson's
disease by the year 2020.

At present, there are more than 127,000 individuals suffering from the grave-
inspiring ailment, which generally tends to target muscular movement. But
still, the figure is likely to reach a massive 162,000 by the year 2020. The
statements have been based on an estimate made after analyzing the General
Practice Research Database. Apart from the increase stated above, the number
of people suffering from motor neurone disease is expected to spike up by more
than 27% during the same period.

While expressing his views in this regard, the Chief Executive of Parkinson's
UK, Steve Ford, said that the Government was in fact having had "it's head in
the sand" and in addition to it, the demands for a "neurology tsar" for
sorting out the entire scenario are gradually spiking up.

The Neurological Alliance covers the responsibility of as many as 70 groups,
and it was of the opinion that an amalgamation of cheap services and
increasing number of cases was in fact causing fair amount of troublesome
issues.

It further took the bull by its horns, claiming that the NHS is not being able
to fulfill its duties in this regard, while the government claimed that it is
fully aware of whatever is going around in the region.

The government assured that it is completely in the know that there is a dire
need for doing something that can ensure people get the best of services and
the perilous issues of life-threatening diseases like the Parkinson's disease
can be curbed in the nick of time.

The comments from the alliance narrowly tailed a report, released recently by
the National Audit Office, which thoroughly condemned the standards of care
being provided by the NHS.
