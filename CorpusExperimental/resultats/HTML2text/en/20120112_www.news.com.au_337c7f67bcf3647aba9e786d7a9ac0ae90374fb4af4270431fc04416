** ELTON John is writing his first book, which will ask why more isn't being done to fight the AIDS crisis.  **

The musician says _Love is the Cure: Ending the Global AIDS Epidemic_ will
include memories of friends who died of AIDS-related illnesses, including
Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.

British publisher Hodder &amp; Stoughton says the book will be published in
July along with an audio book read by the British pop star.

Proceeds will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

John said on Monday the book would ask why more was not being done to cure the
disease.

He said AIDS "is a disease that must be cured not by a miraculous vaccine, but
by changing hearts and minds, and through a collective effort to break down
social barriers".
