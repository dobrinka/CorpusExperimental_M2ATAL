The five-year-old girl who was bitten by a Mozambican spitting cobra shortly
before Christmas is well on her way to recovery.

Skin grafts performed on the arm of a girl, 5, who was bitten by a Mozambican
spitting cobra shortly before Christmas have been a success and she is well on
her way to recovery.

This is the word from Dr Kobie Marais, head of nursing at the Steve Biko
Academic Hospital.

Mikayla Robbertse, underwent surgery on her left arm on Tuesday last week. A
team of plastic surgeons performed a split skin graft on her upper arm and
then attached her hand to her groin in a procedure known as a "groin flap".

The healthy skin in her groin area assisted with skin growth and blood flow in
her hand damaged by the snake's poison which had spread through the tissue.

"The skin on her upper arm is healing beautifully. In two weeks' time we will
know if the skin on her hand has taken successfully.

"We are very confident that the procedure was a success," Marais said.

Mikayla's grandmother, Charmaine Robbertse, said on Wednesday that Mikayla was
back to her old self.

"She is walking around, playing princess and colouring in. She is a real busy
bee," Robbertse said.

Robbertse said Mikayla understood that she had to keep her arm as still as
possible. "I'm trying to entertain her (with) DVDs on my laptop. Kung Fu Panda
and Barbie are her favourites."

Mikayla's grandfather Bertus will this weekend see her for the first time
after her surgery. He had to return to their Lephalale farm last week.

"He is so excited. He will not believe his eyes when he sees how well she is
doing," Robbertse said.

Mikayla was bitten by a cobra on her hand and elbow on the family farm 8km
outside Lephalale soon after going to bed on December 19.

She was taken to the state hospital in Lephalale and treated with antivenom
before being transferred to Steve Biko hospital. - Pretoria News
