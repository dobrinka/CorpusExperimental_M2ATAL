**Predators Pick Prey that Balances Their Diet**  
Thursday, January 12, 2012

University researchers have debunked the dogma that predators aren't picky
eaters, with a new study finding predator animals that are given a choice of
foods will select a diet that maximizes their chances of reproducing.

The researchers, including Professor Stephen Simpson, an internationally
renowned biologist from the University of Sydney, have shown for the first
time that predatory animals choose their food on the basis of its nutritional
value rather than just overall calorie content.

The findings, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Wednesday
11 January, are based on a study of the ground beetle, Anchomenus dorsalis, a
garden insect that feasts on slugs, aphids, moths, beetle larvae and ants.

The international team of scientists from the University of Sydney, the
universities of Exeter and Oxford in the UK, Aarhus University in Denmark and
Massey University in New Zealand, collected female beetles from the wild and
split them into two groups in the laboratory.

Half of the beetles were offered a choice of foods - some that were high in
protein and some that were high in fat. The other half were not given a choice
of foods: some of these beetles were only given high protein food, while the
rest were just given high fat foods.

The beetles that were given a choice of foods ate the proportions of protein
and fat that were optimal for producing healthy eggs. These beetles produced
more eggs than the other beetles in the study that had no choice of foods.

"Contrary to standard dogma, predators do balance their diet and show
nutritional wisdom," said Professor Simpson, an ARC Laureate Fellow in the
School of Biological Sciences at the University of Sydney and the paper's
senior author.

"Although we previously demonstrated this characteristic in spiders, predatory
beetles, fish, mink and cats, this is the first study to show the adaptive
reasons and benefits of diet selection," Professor Simpson said.

The finding could have implications for predator killing and eating patterns
in particular environments, with important consequences for food webs and
ecological communities, said Professor Simpson.

"Immediately after winter hibernation, when both predators and the prey are
likely to have depleted fat stores, predators are likely to kill and eat more
prey than if the prey were rich in fats. Conversely, if some prey species
contain a higher concentration of fats than is optimal for the predator, then
predators should switch their focus towards more protein-rich prey species."

Previous research on insects has shown that herbivores such as butterfly
larvae and grasshoppers, and omnivores such as fruit flies and crickets,
select food to give them a balanced diet. This is the first research to show
that predators also select food on the basis of nutritional value.

Lead researcher Dr Kim Jensen of the University of Exeter said: "At a time of
year when many of us are focused on healthy eating, it is interesting to see
that predators are also selective about what they eat.

"Biologists have previously assumed that predators cannot afford to be fussy
and are simply focused on getting the right quantity of food, rather than
quality. We show for the first time that they do actually select the foods
that will give them the right balance of nutrients."
