# Nurse training cut in London 'deeply concerning' \- RCN

A reduction in training places for nurses in London is "deeply concerning",
the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned.

NHS London is cutting the number of trainee nurses from 2,000 to 1,580 a year.

The organisation claims the change will allow it to raise standards of
teaching.

But the RCN warned of the possibility of "chronic shortages" of nurses, with
staff poached from abroad.

RCN chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: "We are deeply concerned at this
reduction in nurse training places.

"The nursing workforce has grown in recent years, but only just enough to keep
up with rising demands on healthcare.

"It is vital to avoid a return to the chronic shortages of the early 1990s and
the old boom-and-bust cycle of NHS workforce planning."

'Wasted investment'

He continued: "NHS London needs to produce a robust plan guaranteeing
continued investment in nurse training and education.

"The vast majority of newly qualified nurses are dedicated professionals, who
are committed to providing the highest possible standards of patient care.

"Having the right numbers and mix of healthcare professionals is pivotal in
enabling these nurses to provide this high quality care."

Dr Anne Rainsberry of NHS London said: "Figures show that if we continue to
train the same number of adult nurses as we currently do, there will soon be
more trained nurses than there are jobs available.

"This would leave graduates out of work and waste the taxpayers' investment in
their training.

"By reducing the number of training places for adult nurses next year, we can
invest in training more nurses where London really needs them - like
increasing the number of health visitors and children's nurses working in the
capital."
