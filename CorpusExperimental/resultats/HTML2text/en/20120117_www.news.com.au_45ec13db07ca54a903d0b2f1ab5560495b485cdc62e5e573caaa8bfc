** HE has never had sex, yet fathers 14 children.  **

Trent Arsenault hit the headlines last December when his free sperm bank came
under investigation from the US Food and Drug Administration, which threatened
him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.

Now, the Fremont, California local who bills himself as having an ideal gene
pool to father children, has revealed that he is a 36-year-old virgin.

The revelation on CNN host Anderson Cooper's daytime show, _Anderson_, means
that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself
in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14
healthy offspring.

Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: "I coined this term 'donor
sexual' and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for
producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other
activity outside of that."

An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: "So you do not have sex?"

"I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin," the donor explained. "Except I'll
have 15 plus kids" \- a statement that drew applause from the audience, to the
confusion of the host.

The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as
Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage.

A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a "a thrill". The
toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the
donor's decision to help them conceive.
