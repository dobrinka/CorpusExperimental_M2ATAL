Women 'more confused' over implants

(UKPA) - 36 minutes ago

The trade body representing private clinics at the centre of the PIP breast
implant scandal has claimed women are more "confused and anxious" than ever.

Sally Taber, director of the Independent Healthcare Advisory Services (IHAS),
defended private cosmetic surgery firms following Health Secretary Andrew
Lansley's statement on the position for NHS and private patients.

The Harley Medical Group, which fitted PIP breast implants to almost 14,000
British women, has said it will not replace them free of charge. The firm
fitted more of the implants than any other UK cosmetic surgery firm but claims
replacing the banned implants would put it out of business. Another private
company, Transform, has also said it will not replace the implants free of
charge. Other providers including BMI Healthcare, Nuffield Health and Spire
have agreed to offer free removal.

Around 40,000 British women received PIP implants manufactured by the now
closed French company Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP). The implants were filled
with non-medical grade silicone intended for use in mattresses.

The Government has said anxious patients who had their surgery on the NHS will
be able to have the implants removed and replaced free of charge. The NHS will
also pay to remove, but not replace, implants if a private clinic refuses to
do so or no longer exists.

On Wednesday, Mr Lansley reiterated the Government's view that private clinics
have a moral duty to look after their patients. He also announced further
investigations into the scandal, including looking at the EU approval of the
devices which resulted in them receiving a CE mark. The actions of the
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK will also
be analysed further.

Ms Taber welcomed much of Mr Lansley's announcement but said providers were
affected by the "MHRA failure to detect the faulty" implants.

She added: "Whilst the intention of the Health Secretary was to offer
guidance, patients are feeling more confused and anxious now than ever before.
With the current Government position remaining unclear, patients want to know
the timeline for the further investigations into PIP implants by the MHRA.
There is need for clarity on how patients can access scans and ensuring that
all GPs are authorised to order scans."

She added: "Members of IHAS are as much a victim of this fraud as the NHS and
the patients. We all trusted the standards regulator, the MHRA, and the
Department of Health.

"If there is any moral or ethical obligation outstanding it lies with the
Government's regulatory agency, the MHRA. But the overriding issue here is
that it is in everyone's interest to work together to ensure that patients are
treated with compassion."
