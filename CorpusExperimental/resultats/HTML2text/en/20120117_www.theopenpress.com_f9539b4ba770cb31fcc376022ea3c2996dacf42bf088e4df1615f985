January 16, 2012 - In this day and age of unhealthy eating and other habits,
coupled with an unclean environment and stress, failing to lose weight after
months and months of trying is becoming an everyday sad story. Cruel dieting
statistics reveal that 95% of weight loss efforts based on dieting alone are
doomed to fail within three to five years.  
  
A revolutionary weight loss solution pioneered in the 1950s, HCG drops is
widely recognized for improving the body's ability to burn fat more
efficiently and help dieters take control over their eating habits and free
them from their current weight condition. HCG stands for Human Chorionic
Gonadotripin, which is a hormone naturally produced during pregnancy that has
been found to aid in weight loss. Most hcg diet protocols are based on the
principles of discoverer Dr. A.T.W. Simeons, and use all natural substances to
create an all-natural synthetic HCG for healthy weight loss.  
  
hcgDropsCentral.com is a website that caters to individuals who are looking
for the right hcg drops and hcg diet plan to reap its weight loss benefits in
a safe, fast and efficient manner. The online shop has even added a special
blend of unique amino acids to make every hcg drop even more powerful in
helping suppress the appetite and make it easier to stick to the low-calorie
required by the hcg diet plan. The most popular option is the 43-day plan,
which follows the guidelines originally set for by Dr. Simeons himself.  
  
hcgDropsCentral.com has helped more than 25,000 dieters around the world reach
their dieting goals. Susan Roules from Irving, Texas talks about her hcg
weight loss success: "Ever since having my first child, I weighed a little
more than I would have liked. Thanks to hcgDropsCEntral, I lost a total of 37
pounds. I figure my husband owes me vacations to the beach for this amazing
feat!"  
  
Customers who order their hcg diet plan at hcgDropsCentral.com can choose
among the webshop's elite, standard or premium package which all include a
special blend of hcg drops that comes with extra amino acids like Arginine,
L-Carnitine and Ornithine to help maximize weight loss. An official hcg guide
is also provided to outline step-by-step what dieters need to do to lose 1 to
2 pounds of unwanted fat a day.  
  
In addition, hcgDropsCentral.com offers the "Pounds and Inches" manuscript by
Dr. Simeons, which allows a more in-depth look at how to lose weight with hcg
drops. A complimentary hcg cookbook also comes with the purchase to offer
ideas and recipes that spice up the daily diet.  
  
HCGDropsCentral.com underscores that its hcg detox drops are only made in the
United States following the strictest and most up-to date regulations in a
FDA-approved facility. Fully confident of its products, hcgDropsCentral.com
offers an industry-leading 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.  
  
People who have long been struggling with managing their weight should check
out hcgdropscentral.com for more information.
