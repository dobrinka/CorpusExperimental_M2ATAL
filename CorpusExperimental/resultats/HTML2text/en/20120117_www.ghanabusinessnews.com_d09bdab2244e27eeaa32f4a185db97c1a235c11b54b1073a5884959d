women he met in Hampshire in the UK with the HIV virus, reports in the British
media say.

Mr Assumang, 33, according to the BBC today January 16, 2012 denied two counts
of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the women, who cannot be identified for
legal reasons.

Assumang, who is HIV positive, is accused of having sexual relationships with
the women between 2007 and 2010 after meeting them in Basingstoke, the
broadcaster says.

He has been granted bail as the case is adjourned for trial starting June 11.
