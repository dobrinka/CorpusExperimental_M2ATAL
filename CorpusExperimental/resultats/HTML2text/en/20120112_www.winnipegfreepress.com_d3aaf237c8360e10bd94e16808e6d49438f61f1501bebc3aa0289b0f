The province will give $555,000 to the Alzheimer Society of Manitoba (ASM)
over the next three years to support the new First Link program that helps
families affected by Alzheimer's disease, Premier Greg Selinger said today.

First Link brings services and supports to people affected by Alzheimer's
disease or related dementia as soon as possible after diagnosis. Supports
include information, support groups, education sessions and referral to other
health agencies or resources. While physicians and health-care providers can
make referrals to First Link, individuals and their families can also contact
ASM directly.

More than 19,000 Manitobans have Alzheimer's disease or other forms of
dementia. In 2011 alone, more than 4,300 Manitobans over 65 developed
Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia.

To access First Link, contact ASM directly at 204-943-6622, toll-free at
1-800-378-6699 or online at www.alzheimer.mb.ca/.
