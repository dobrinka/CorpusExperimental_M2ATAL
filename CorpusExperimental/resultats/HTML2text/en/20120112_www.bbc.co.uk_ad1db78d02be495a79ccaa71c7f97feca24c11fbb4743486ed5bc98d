# Confiscated bushmeat 'poses virus threat'

![Bushmeat](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/57825000/jpg/_57825113_13472
9647.jpg) Much of the trade in wildlife meat, or bushmeat, has its origin in
Africa

Scientists have documented potentially dangerous viruses entering the US
through illegally imported wildlife products.

Testing of meats confiscated at American airports has revealed the presence of
several pathogens that could pose a risk to human health.

Retroviruses and herpesviruses were identified, some of them isolated from
remains of endangered monkey species.

The research study is reported in the journal PLoS One.

Its authors say better surveillance measures are needed to ensure this trade
does not result in the emergence of new disease outbreaks in humans.

"Although the findings to date are from a small pilot study, they remind us of
the potential public health risk posed by illegal importation of wildlife
products - a risk we hope to better characterize through expanded surveillance
at ports of entry around the country," said Dr Kristine Smith, from EcoHealth
Alliance, who led the investigation team.

Scientists estimate that some 75% of emerging infectious diseases affecting
people have come from contact with wildlife.

Some of this is the result of animals biting humans, but the handling and
consumption of infected meats is also considered a significant route of
transmission.

Classic examples of infections that have jumped across the species include
HIV/Aids, which is thought to have originated in primates, and Sars, an
infection that caused global concern in 2003.

Follow-up work traced its beginnings to Chinese restaurant workers butchering
the cat-like Asian palm civet.

The PLoS One study is a first attempt to screen for potentially hazardous
pathogens in confiscated meat products entering the US.

The scientists examined animal remains passing through five international
airports, including John F Kennedy in New York - one of the busiest hubs in
the world.

The smuggled meats - some found in postal packages, some discovered inside
suitcases - were tested first to make a species identification.

This showed up several non-human primates, included baboon and chimpanzee, but
also rodents.

The raw, smoked and dried meats were then tested for a number of viruses known
to be capable of infecting humans.

Among the pathogens identified were a zoonotic retrovirus, simian foamy
viruses, and several nonhuman primate herpesviruses.

No-one really knows the scale of the illegal trade in wildlife meat, or
bushmeat as it is often called, but a 2010 study estimated that five tonnes of
the material per week was being smuggled in personal baggage through Roissy-
Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France.

And in addition to the meat products, there is a big trade in live wild
animals. Much of this is perfectly legal and supplies the pet industry.
Nonetheless, these animals also require improved pathogen surveillance, say
the researchers.

"Exotic wildlife pets and bushmeat are Trojan horses that threaten humankind
at sites where they are collected in the developing world as well as the US.
Our study underscores the importance of surveillance at ports, but we must
also encourage efforts to reduce demand for products that drive the wildlife
trade," said Ian Lipkin of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public
Health.

One key aspect of concern highlighted by the team was the identification in
the samples of some endangered species, including the Guinea baboon and the
sooty mangabey, an Old World monkey.

Marcus Rowcliffe, from the Institute of Zoology in London, UK, and who was not
connected with the research, commented: "The extent to which an
intercontinental luxury meat market may be developing is of major concern,
because if that is happening it could have very worrying impacts on wild
populations.

"This whole area is marked by a lot of unknowns which is why we need more
studies like this."
