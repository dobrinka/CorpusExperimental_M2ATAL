Evidence of a previously unknown Viking king has been discovered in a hoard of
silver found by a metal detectorist, stashed in a lead box in a field in
Lancashire.

The 201 pieces of silver including beautiful arm rings, worn by Viking
warriors, were found on the outskirts of Silverdale, a village near the coast
in north Lancashire, by Darren Webster, using the metal detector his wife gave
him as a Christmas present. It adds up to more than 1kg of silver, probably
stashed for safe keeping around AD900 at a time of wars and power struggles
among the Vikings of northern England, and never recovered.

Airdeconut – thought to be the Anglo Saxon coin maker's struggle to get to
grips with the Viking name Harthacnut – was found on one of the coins in the
hoard.

The Airdeconut coin also reveals that within a generation of the Vikings
starting to colonise permanent settlements in Britain in the 870s – instead of
coming as summer raiders – their kings had allied themselves to the Christian
god. The reverse of the coin has the words DNS – for Dominus – Rex, arranged
as a cross.

The hoard is regarded as among the best found this century, and the fact that
it was never recovered suggests its owner came to an untimely end.

"It was a considerable sum of money, the price of a reasonable herd of cattle,
or a very good herd of sheep," Gareth Williams, a coins expert at the British
Museum where the hoard is being studied, said. "One arm ring alone would just
buy you an ox."

Webster had collected his son from school, and was heading back to work – but
he decided to allow himself a few hours in a field where he had been several
times before, but never found anything more exciting than a Tudor half groat.

He hit a strong signal almost immediately, and uncovered a sheet of lead only
a few inches down – and was slightly disappointed with his find. The lead
proved to be crudely folded into a container, and when he lifted it he
released a shower of pieces of silver.

"I knew when I saw the bracelets it had to be Viking," he said. "When I heard
later there was one coin that nobody had ever seen before, that was a strange
feeling."

The find will go through a treasure inquest next week to determine its value.
The reward will be shared between Webster and the land owner. The Museum of
Lancaster hopes to raise funds to buy the hoard.

The hoard also had coins minted for Alwaldus, who defected to the Vikings in
Northumbria after an unsuccessful attempt to claim the English crown from his
considerably better known uncle, Alfred the Great. The Vikings allowed him to
call himself a king, but he only survived a few years before dying in battle.

There are also Frankish and Islamic coins, but one of the more intriguing
would have been worthless to the original owner. Williams explained that
silver coins are often found in Viking hoards, which have been tested by
clipping or bending: the scruffy little fake, of copper with the thinnest film
of silver almost worn away, shows what they were wary of.

One of the arm rings – usually given by leaders to their warriors in return
for services rendered and expected – is particularly unusual, combining Irish,
Anglo Saxon and Carolingian style ornament.

Another Viking hoard was found in the next parish in the 1990s, and the site
is only about 97km (60 miles) from one of the most famous Viking hoards ever
uncovered, the 8,600 pieces of silver, 40kg in total, of the Cuerdale hoard.
Staff at the British Museum have been working on the definitive account of its
discovery by workmen in 1840, and the contents of the treasure – some closely
resembling pieces from the Silverdale hoard – are now within months of
publication after a mere 130 years devoted to the task.

The British Museum also announced the most recent results for the treasure
finds scheme and the portable antiquities scheme , which encourages voluntary
reporting by amateurs of less valuable – but historically priceless – finds. A
total of 157,188 antiquities finds were reported, and 1,638 treasure finds in
2009 and 2010,up from 19 reported treasure finds in 1988, an indication of the
spectacular increase in reporting since a network of finds officers was
established across the country. Treasure finds included a bronze age hoard
found near Lewes in East Sussex, evidence of the complex trading networks
3,500 years ago: the objects included gold-foil decoration from northern
France, amber beads, which may have come from the Baltic, along with "Sussex
loop" bracelets, which have only ever been found within an 80km (50-mile)
radius of Brighton.
