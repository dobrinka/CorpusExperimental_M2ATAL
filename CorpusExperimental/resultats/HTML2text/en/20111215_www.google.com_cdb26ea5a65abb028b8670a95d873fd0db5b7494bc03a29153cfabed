Fears for future care of troops

(UKPA) - 18 hours ago

A powerful committee has raised concerns over the future care of troops
returning from service with severe injuries and mental health problems.

MPs said there was a "question mark" over whether the Government had fully
understood the scale of the demands on services in the coming years.

In a report on military casualties following the introduction in May of the
Armed Forces Covenant, which sets out the "moral obligation" to support
service personnel, the Commons Defence Committee praised "the first-class
medical treatment" available but questioned whether it was sustainable.

MPs also called on the Government to act "urgently" to exclude Armed Forces
compensation - paid to injured personnel - from consideration when means-
tested benefits are assessed.

Ministers have indicated the practice could be reformed next year but the
committee warned that "there is a risk that in the short-term some members of
the Armed Forces might be disadvantaged" without swift reforms.

The committee said that while the Ministry of Defence provided "outstanding
care" in many areas "this cannot always be said for the support it gives to
families". It criticised the lack of support for children following the death
or severe injury of a relative and urged the department to "look again" at its
support services.

MPs also raised fears that the Government's reforms of the NHS - the largest
shake-up in its history - will hit the future care of troops.

"We are concerned that the arrangements put in place by the MoD for the
transition of personnel may be disrupted by the future re-organisation of the
health service in England," the report states.

Committee chairman James Arbuthnot said: "We, as a committee, have seen how
determined our injured servicemen and women are to achieve the fullest
possible recovery from their injuries. They see it as duty to get better and
to return to their units if at all possible.

"We have been impressed by the brave and skilful personnel, both military and
civilian, who are providing the medical care that our Armed Forces need. But
we need to have the confidence that such specific treatment, for injuries
hardly ever seen in the general NHS experience, will continue long after an
individual's retirement and into old age."
