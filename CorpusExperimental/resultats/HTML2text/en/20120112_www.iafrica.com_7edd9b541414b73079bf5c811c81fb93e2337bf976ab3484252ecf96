# 'Fresh, as in f**king fresh!'

Article By: Phoenix Miles

Thu, 12 Jan 2012 10:20

One culture's swear word is another one's favourite adjective. It seems Japan
has adopted one of the West's nasty four-lettered words with great gusto,
using it to describe anything that's really fantastic.

A New Yorker says he is to blame for this recent phenomenon. Owner and chef
for a restaurant chain called Bubby's, Ron Silver was in Yokohama, Japan in
2009 setting up a branch of the restaurant there when he insisted on fresh
produce. According to Silver, the Japanese use a lot of frozen goods and in
his frustration to explain fresh to his staff, he ranted at them, "I mean
_f**king fresh_, man."

The following day, his staff asked him whether by fresh he meant canned, which
started him ranting again, " What do you not understand about _f**ing fresh_?"

According to the original report on Gawker.com, Silver's staff may have been
teasing him the whole time as they soon decorated the Bubby's logo with the
slogan, "f***kin fresh".

So catchy is it, that it's become the unofficial slogan of the Osaka branch,
written on the menus and adverts, like "F**kin Fresh &amp; Delicious food" and
"Bubby's F**kin Fresh lemonade" -- dropping the "g" seems a popular spelling
of the word.

Now, it seems, the new-found adjective has been adopted elsewhere, with signs
advertising a "f**kin sale" in Osaka, Japan, recently reported by Gawker.com.

Whether or not the phrase originated at Bubby's, one thing is for certain, the
Japanese have a certain way with the English language.
